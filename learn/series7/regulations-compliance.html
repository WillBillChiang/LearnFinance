        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Securities Act of 1933 ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="securities-act-1933">
          <h2>Securities Act of 1933</h2>

          <p>The regulatory framework governing the U.S. securities industry is built upon a series of landmark federal laws, self-regulatory organization rules, and industry practices. As a Series 7 candidate, you must understand these regulations in depth — not just the rules themselves, but how they apply in real-world scenarios. This chapter covers the major securities laws, FINRA rules, anti-money laundering requirements, communication rules, and compliance obligations that every registered representative must know.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Securities Act of 1933</strong> — often called the "Paper Act" or the "Truth in Securities Act" — was the first major federal securities law. Enacted in response to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, its two primary objectives are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Require issuers to provide investors with <strong>material information</strong> about securities being offered for public sale through a registration statement and prospectus</li>
            <li>Prohibit <strong>fraud and misrepresentation</strong> in the sale of securities</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Registration Requirements</h3>

          <p>Under the 1933 Act, all securities offered to the public must be <strong>registered with the SEC</strong> unless they qualify for an exemption. The registration process requires filing a <strong>registration statement</strong> (typically Form S-1 for IPOs) containing detailed financial and business information. The registration statement has two parts: Part I is the <strong>prospectus</strong> (which must be delivered to investors), and Part II contains additional information filed with the SEC but not required to be given to investors.</p>

          <h3>The Prospectus</h3>

          <p>The <strong>prospectus</strong> is the primary disclosure document for new securities offerings. It must include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Description of the company's business and properties</li>
            <li>Description of the security being offered</li>
            <li>Information about company management</li>
            <li>Audited financial statements</li>
            <li>Risk factors</li>
            <li>Use of proceeds</li>
            <li>Underwriting arrangements and fees</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The SEC does NOT approve or disapprove of any securities. It only ensures that proper disclosure has been made. Any statement suggesting SEC approval is a violation of the law.</p>

          <h3>Exempt Securities</h3>

          <p>Certain securities are <strong>exempt from registration</strong> under the 1933 Act (but NOT from anti-fraud provisions):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>U.S. government securities</strong> (Treasuries, agency securities)</li>
            <li><strong>Municipal securities</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Commercial paper</strong> with maturities of 270 days or less</li>
            <li><strong>Bank securities</strong> (issued by national or state-chartered banks)</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance policies and annuity contracts</strong> (regulated by state insurance commissioners, except variable products)</li>
            <li><strong>Non-profit and religious organization securities</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Exempt Transactions</h3>

          <p>Certain <strong>transactions</strong> are exempt from registration (the security itself is not exempt — only the specific transaction):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Regulation D (Private Placements):</strong> Sales to accredited investors (institutions, high-net-worth individuals) and a limited number of non-accredited investors. No general solicitation permitted under Rule 506(b); general solicitation allowed under Rule 506(c) if all purchasers are verified accredited investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation A/A+ (Small Offerings):</strong> Tier 1 allows raises up to $20 million; Tier 2 allows up to $75 million in a 12-month period with ongoing reporting requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 147 (Intrastate Offerings):</strong> Securities offered and sold only to residents of a single state, by an issuer incorporated and doing business in that state.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 144:</strong> Governs the resale of restricted and control securities. Restricted securities must be held for at least 6 months (if the issuer is a reporting company) before resale. Affiliates must also comply with volume limitations, manner of sale requirements, and filing Form 144.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="exchange-act-1934">
          <h2>Securities Exchange Act of 1934</h2>

          <p>The <strong>Securities Exchange Act of 1934</strong> — often called the "People Act" — created the SEC and governs the <strong>secondary market</strong> (trading of already-issued securities). While the 1933 Act focuses on new issues, the 1934 Act focuses on ongoing trading, reporting, and market conduct.</p>

          <h3>Key Provisions</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Created the SEC</strong> as the primary federal securities regulator</li>
            <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Requires registration of exchanges, broker-dealers, and transfer agents</li>
            <li><strong>Periodic reporting:</strong> Public companies must file annual reports (Form 10-K), quarterly reports (Form 10-Q), and current event reports (Form 8-K)</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy rules:</strong> Regulates the solicitation of proxies from shareholders for corporate votes</li>
            <li><strong>Insider trading:</strong> Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 prohibit any person from using material, nonpublic information (MNPI) to trade securities or to tip others who trade</li>
            <li><strong>Section 16 reporting:</strong> Officers, directors, and 10% shareholders must report their transactions in company stock and are subject to the short-swing profit rule (profits from buy-sell or sell-buy within 6 months must be disgorged to the company)</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure):</strong> Prohibits selective disclosure of material nonpublic information. If an issuer discloses MNPI to certain market professionals or shareholders, it must simultaneously (for intentional disclosures) or promptly (for unintentional disclosures) make the information public</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation T:</strong> Grants the Federal Reserve authority to set margin requirements</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: FINRA Rules ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="finra-rules">
          <h2>Key FINRA Rules</h2>

          <p>FINRA rules govern the conduct of broker-dealers and their registered representatives. The Series 7 exam tests several specific FINRA rules in detail. You must know the rule numbers, their requirements, and how they apply in practice.</p>

          <h3>Rule 2010 — Standards of Commercial Honor</h3>

          <p><strong>FINRA Rule 2010</strong> is a broad ethical standard requiring that members, in the conduct of their business, "observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade." This catch-all rule can be used to discipline conduct that violates the spirit of fair dealing, even if no specific rule is broken. Examples include lying on compliance questionnaires, personal financial misconduct (writing bad checks, tax evasion), and failure to cooperate with FINRA investigations.</p>

          <h3>Rule 2111 — Suitability</h3>

          <p>As discussed in Chapter 10, <strong>Rule 2111</strong> requires that recommended transactions be suitable based on reasonable-basis, customer-specific, and quantitative suitability obligations. This rule is complemented by Regulation Best Interest for retail customer recommendations.</p>

          <h3>Rule 2210 — Communications with the Public</h3>

          <p><strong>Rule 2210</strong> governs all communications between broker-dealers and the public. It classifies communications into three categories with different approval requirements:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Retail communication:</strong> Any written or electronic communication distributed or made available to <strong>more than 25 retail investors</strong> within a 30-day period. Examples: advertisements, websites, social media posts, form letters. Must be approved by a <strong>registered principal before first use</strong> (or within 10 business days of first use for certain firms with a strong supervisory track record).</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional communication:</strong> Written or electronic communication distributed or made available <strong>only to institutional investors</strong> (broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, entities with $50M+ in assets, government entities). Does NOT require pre-approval by a principal, but the firm must have supervisory procedures to review these communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> Written or electronic communication distributed to <strong>25 or fewer retail investors</strong> within a 30-day period. Does NOT require pre-approval, but the firm must have procedures to review and supervise correspondence (review may be on a spot-check basis).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>All communications must be fair, balanced, and not misleading. They must provide a sound basis for evaluating the investment. Performance claims must include appropriate risk disclosures, and past performance disclaimers must be included when showing historical returns.</p>

              <p>Social media posts are classified as either <strong>retail communications</strong> (if they can reach more than 25 retail investors, such as a public post) or <strong>correspondence</strong> (if directed to 25 or fewer, such as a private message). Public posts on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Facebook are generally retail communications and require <strong>principal pre-approval</strong>. Firms must have policies governing use of personal devices and social media, including archiving requirements.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Rule 3110 — Supervision</h3>

          <p><strong>Rule 3110</strong> requires each FINRA member firm to establish and maintain a system to <strong>supervise the activities</strong> of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations. Key requirements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The firm must designate <strong>qualified supervisory personnel</strong> for each business unit</li>
            <li>Written <strong>supervisory procedures (WSPs)</strong> must be established and maintained</li>
            <li>Each <strong>Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (OSJ)</strong> must have an on-site supervisor</li>
            <li>The firm must conduct <strong>annual compliance reviews</strong> of its supervisory system</li>
            <li><strong>Branch office inspections</strong> must be conducted at least annually for OSJs and on a regular schedule for non-OSJ branches</li>
            <li>The firm must review and approve customer transactions, correspondence, and advertising</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Rule 4512 — Customer Account Information</h3>

          <p>As discussed in Chapter 10, <strong>Rule 4512</strong> requires member firms to obtain and maintain specific information for each customer account, including name, address, age, occupation, SSN/TIN, and information about association with other member firms.</p>

            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>Beyond the 1933 and 1934 Acts, several other federal securities laws are tested on the Series 7:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Investment Company Act of 1940:</strong> Regulates mutual funds, closed-end funds, UITs, and other investment companies. Requires registration with the SEC and establishes rules for fund governance, fees, and investor protection.</li>

                <li><strong>Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988:</strong> Extends liability to supervisors who fail to prevent insider trading and increases criminal penalties.</li>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: AML Compliance ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="aml-compliance">
          <h2>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance</h2>

          <p>Anti-money laundering compliance is one of the most critical regulatory obligations for broker-dealers. Money laundering — the process of making illegally obtained money appear legitimate — poses serious risks to the financial system. The Series 7 exam tests your understanding of AML laws, reporting requirements, and compliance programs.</p>

          <h3>Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Bank Secrecy Act of 1970</strong> is the foundation of U.S. AML law. It requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. The BSA is enforced by the <strong>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)</strong>, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>

          <h3>Customer Identification Program (CIP)</h3>

          <p>As required by the <strong>USA PATRIOT Act</strong>, every broker-dealer must implement a CIP to verify the identity of each customer who opens an account. The CIP requires obtaining the customer's name, date of birth, address, and government-issued identification number. The firm must verify this information within a reasonable time using documentary or non-documentary methods.</p>

          <h3>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</h3>

          <p>Broker-dealers must file a <strong>Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)</strong> with FinCEN when they detect known or suspected violations of federal law, or suspicious transactions that may involve money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activity involving <strong>$5,000 or more</strong>. SARs must be filed within <strong>30 days</strong> of the initial detection of the suspicious activity (60 days if no suspect is identified). It is a <strong>federal crime</strong> to inform the subject of a SAR that a report has been filed (known as "tipping off").</p>

          <h3>Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)</h3>

          <p>A <strong>Currency Transaction Report (CTR)</strong> must be filed with FinCEN for any <strong>cash transaction exceeding $10,000</strong> in a single business day. This applies to deposits, withdrawals, or exchanges of currency. Multiple transactions by the same person that aggregate over $10,000 in a single day must also be reported (anti-structuring rules). <strong>Structuring</strong> — intentionally breaking up transactions to avoid the $10,000 threshold — is itself a federal crime.</p>

          <h3>OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>OFAC</strong>, part of the U.S. Treasury Department, administers and enforces economic sanctions programs against targeted countries, individuals, and entities. Broker-dealers must screen customers and transactions against the <strong>Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list</strong>. Transacting with persons or entities on the SDN list is prohibited and can result in severe civil and criminal penalties.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>Remember the key AML thresholds: <strong>SAR = $5,000+</strong> (suspicious activity), <strong>CTR = $10,000+</strong> (cash transactions). SARs are filed within 30 days and are <strong>confidential</strong> — you must never tell the customer a SAR was filed. Also remember that every firm must designate an <strong>AML Compliance Officer</strong> and conduct independent AML testing.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 5: Complaints, Arbitration, and Records ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="complaints-arbitration-records">
          <h2>Customer Complaints, Arbitration, and Books and Records</h2>

          <h3>Customer Complaints</h3>

          <p>FINRA rules require specific procedures for handling customer complaints. A <strong>complaint</strong> is defined as any written statement of a grievance involving a FINRA member or associated person's business activities. Key requirements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>All written complaints must be <strong>reported to the firm's compliance department</strong></li>
            <li>The firm must <strong>acknowledge receipt</strong> of the complaint promptly</li>
            <li>Complaints must be maintained in a <strong>complaint file</strong> and reported on the registered representative's Form U4/U5</li>
            <li>Certain complaints must be reported to FINRA through the firm's regular reporting process</li>
            <li>Representatives may <strong>never settle a customer complaint privately</strong> without the firm's knowledge and approval</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>FINRA Arbitration</h3>

          <p><strong>Arbitration</strong> is the primary method for resolving disputes in the securities industry. FINRA operates the largest securities dispute resolution forum in the United States. Key features:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mandatory arbitration:</strong> Disputes between broker-dealers and between broker-dealers and registered representatives must go through FINRA arbitration (it is in the employment agreement). Customer disputes may go to arbitration if the customer signed a predispute arbitration agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified arbitration:</strong> For claims of $50,000 or less, a single arbitrator decides the case based on documents only (no hearing unless requested).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard arbitration:</strong> For claims over $50,000 and up to $100,000, a single arbitrator conducts a hearing. For claims over $100,000, a panel of three arbitrators conducts the hearing.</li>
            <li>Arbitration decisions are <strong>final and binding</strong> — there is very limited right of appeal to the courts.</li>
            <li>The <strong>statute of limitations</strong> for filing an arbitration claim is <strong>6 years</strong> from the occurrence or event giving rise to the claim.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Mediation</strong> is a voluntary, non-binding alternative to arbitration where a neutral mediator helps the parties reach a settlement. Either party can withdraw from mediation at any time.</p>

          <h3>Books and Records Requirements</h3>

          <p>SEC Rules <strong>17a-3</strong> and <strong>17a-4</strong> specify the books and records that broker-dealers must create and maintain:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rule 17a-3:</strong> Specifies which records must be <strong>created</strong>, including trade blotters, ledgers, customer account records, order tickets, trade confirmations, and written communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule 17a-4:</strong> Specifies <strong>retention periods</strong> for records:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>6 years:</strong> Trade blotters, general ledger, customer account records, customer statements</li>
                <li><strong>3 years:</strong> Trade confirmations, customer complaints, written communications (including emails)</li>
                <li><strong>Lifetime of the firm:</strong> Articles of incorporation, partnership agreements, minute books</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Business Continuity Plans (BCP)</h3>

          <p><strong>FINRA Rule 4370</strong> requires every member firm to create and maintain a <strong>Business Continuity Plan (BCP)</strong> that addresses how the firm will respond to significant business disruptions. The BCP must cover:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Data backup and recovery procedures</li>
            <li>Alternate communications channels for customers and employees</li>
            <li>Critical business functions and how they will be maintained</li>
            <li>Financial and operational assessments</li>
            <li>Customer access to funds and securities</li>
            <li>Regulatory reporting during disruptions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The BCP must be reviewed and updated at least annually. A summary of the BCP must be provided to each customer at account opening and posted on the firm's website.</p>

            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>Regulatory compliance is not just about knowing the rules — it is about understanding how they protect investors and maintain market integrity. The 1933 Act ensures disclosure in new offerings. The 1934 Act governs ongoing trading and reporting. FINRA rules set conduct standards for the industry. AML rules prevent financial crimes. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that every registered representative must understand and follow.</p>

            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">1. The Securities Act of 1933 primarily regulates which market?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) The primary market (new issues)</button>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              The Securities Act of 1933 (the "Paper Act") regulates the primary market — the issuance and initial sale of new securities to the public. It requires registration and prospectus delivery. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary market (ongoing trading).

          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">2. Under FINRA Rule 2210, a public post on a firm's social media page would be classified as:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) Retail communication</button>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              A public social media post can be viewed by more than 25 retail investors, making it a retail communication under FINRA Rule 2210. Retail communications must be approved by a registered principal before first use (or within 10 business days for firms with a strong track record). Public-facing content always qualifies as retail communication.

            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">3. A broker-dealer suspects a customer is engaged in money laundering involving $8,000. What must the firm do?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              A SAR must be filed for any suspicious activity involving $5,000 or more. Since $8,000 exceeds the SAR threshold, the firm must file a SAR with FinCEN within 30 days. A CTR is for cash transactions over $10,000. The firm must NEVER notify the customer that a SAR has been filed — this is called "tipping off" and is a federal crime.

            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Rule 10b-5 is the broad anti-fraud provision that prohibits any act of fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. This includes insider trading — using material, nonpublic information to trade or tipping others. Short selling and margin trading are legal activities subject to their own regulations.
