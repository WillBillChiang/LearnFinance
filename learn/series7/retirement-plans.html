        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Individual Retirement Accounts Overview ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="individual-retirement-accounts">
          <h2>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</h2>

          <p>Retirement planning is one of the most important aspects of financial advising, and it is heavily tested on the Series 7 exam. As a registered representative, you will need to understand the different types of retirement accounts, their contribution limits, tax advantages, distribution rules, and penalties. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of every retirement plan type you are expected to know.</p>

          <p>Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, are personal retirement savings vehicles that offer tax advantages to encourage Americans to save for retirement. There are two primary types of IRAs: Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Each has distinct rules regarding contributions, deductions, and distributions. Understanding the differences between them is essential for both the Series 7 exam and your career advising clients.</p>

          <h3>Traditional IRA</h3>

          <p>A <strong>Traditional IRA</strong> allows individuals to make contributions that may be tax-deductible, depending on their income and whether they (or their spouse) participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Earnings within the account grow on a tax-deferred basis, meaning you pay no taxes on investment gains, dividends, or interest until you withdraw the money.</p>

          <h4>Contribution Rules</h4>

          <p>To contribute to a Traditional IRA, you must have <strong>earned income</strong> (wages, salaries, self-employment income, tips, bonuses, and commissions). Investment income, rental income, and pension income do not count as earned income for IRA purposes. The annual contribution limit for 2024 is <strong>$7,000</strong> for individuals under age 50, with a <strong>$1,000 catch-up contribution</strong> for those aged 50 and older, bringing the total to $8,000. There is no age limit for making contributions, as long as you have earned income.</p>

          <p>If your spouse has no earned income, you can contribute to a <strong>spousal IRA</strong> on their behalf, subject to the same annual limits. The couple must file a joint tax return, and the working spouse must have enough earned income to cover both contributions.</p>

          <h4>Tax Deductibility</h4>

          <p>Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be fully deductible, partially deductible, or non-deductible depending on two factors: (1) whether the contributor is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, and (2) the contributor's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If neither you nor your spouse participates in an employer plan, your Traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible regardless of income. If you or your spouse is covered by an employer plan, the deduction phases out at certain income levels.</p>

            <div class="callout__header">
              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 2L2 7l10 5 10-5-10-5z"/><path d="M2 17l10 5 10-5"/><path d="M2 12l10 5 10-5"/></svg></div>
              <p class="callout__title">Exam Tip</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>The Series 7 exam commonly tests whether IRA contributions are deductible. Remember the key rule: If <strong>neither spouse</strong> participates in an employer-sponsored plan, contributions are <strong>always fully deductible</strong> regardless of income. Income limits only apply when the taxpayer or spouse is an active participant in an employer plan.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Distributions and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</h4>

          <p>Distributions from a Traditional IRA are taxed as <strong>ordinary income</strong> in the year they are received. If you made non-deductible contributions, a portion of each distribution representing the return of after-tax contributions is not taxed (this is calculated using the pro-rata rule).</p>

          <p><strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong> must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the account owner turns <strong>73</strong> (under the SECURE 2.0 Act). After the first RMD year, subsequent distributions must be taken by December 31 of each year. The RMD amount is calculated by dividing the account balance as of December 31 of the prior year by the applicable life expectancy factor from IRS tables. Failure to take an RMD results in a <strong>25% excise tax</strong> on the amount that should have been withdrawn (reduced from the previous 50% penalty by SECURE 2.0). If corrected in a timely manner, this penalty may be further reduced to 10%.</p>

          <h4>Early Withdrawal Penalty</h4>

          <p>Distributions taken before age <strong>59 1/2</strong> are generally subject to a <strong>10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> in addition to ordinary income tax. However, several exceptions exist where the penalty is waived (though income tax still applies):</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Death</strong> of the IRA owner (beneficiary receives distributions penalty-free)</li>
            <li><strong>Disability</strong> (total and permanent disability as defined by the IRS)</li>
            <li><strong>Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP)</strong> under IRC Section 72(t) — also known as the "72(t) exception"</li>
            <li><strong>First-time homebuyer expenses</strong> (up to $10,000 lifetime)</li>
            <li><strong>Qualified higher education expenses</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Unreimbursed medical expenses</strong> exceeding 7.5% of adjusted gross income</li>
            <li><strong>Health insurance premiums</strong> while unemployed</li>
            <li><strong>IRS levy</strong> on the account</li>
            <li><strong>Birth or adoption expenses</strong> (up to $5,000 per event, under SECURE Act)</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: Roth IRA ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="roth-ira">
          <h2>Roth IRA</h2>

          <p>The <strong>Roth IRA</strong> is fundamentally different from the Traditional IRA in its tax treatment. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with <strong>after-tax dollars</strong> — there is no tax deduction for contributions. However, the major benefit is that qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are completely <strong>tax-free</strong>, including all earnings. This makes the Roth IRA one of the most powerful retirement savings tools available.</p>

          <h3>Contribution Rules and Income Limits</h3>

          <p>The annual contribution limit for a Roth IRA is the same as for a Traditional IRA: <strong>$7,000</strong> (under age 50) or <strong>$8,000</strong> (age 50 and older) for 2024. However, the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA is subject to <strong>income limits</strong>. For single filers, the ability to contribute phases out between $146,000 and $161,000 MAGI. For married filing jointly, the phase-out range is $230,000 to $240,000. If your income exceeds these limits, you cannot contribute directly to a Roth IRA (though you may use a "backdoor Roth" conversion strategy).</p>

          <p>The combined total of your Traditional and Roth IRA contributions cannot exceed the annual limit. You can split contributions between accounts, but the total across all IRAs must stay within the limit.</p>

          <h3>Qualified Distributions (Tax-Free)</h3>

          <p>For a Roth IRA distribution to be <strong>qualified</strong> (and therefore entirely tax-free), two conditions must be met:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>The 5-year rule:</strong> The Roth IRA must have been open for at least 5 tax years from the year of the first contribution.</li>
            <li><strong>A qualifying event:</strong> The distribution must be made after the account owner reaches age 59 1/2, becomes disabled, dies (distribution to beneficiary), or is used for first-time homebuyer expenses (up to $10,000).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>If both conditions are met, the entire distribution — contributions and earnings — is tax-free. If a distribution is not qualified, earnings may be subject to income tax and the 10% early withdrawal penalty. However, <strong>contributions can always be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free</strong> at any time, because they were made with after-tax dollars. The ordering rules dictate that contributions are deemed withdrawn first, then conversions, then earnings.</p>

          <h3>The 5-Year Rule — In Detail</h3>

          <p>The 5-year clock starts on <strong>January 1 of the tax year for which the first Roth IRA contribution is made</strong>. For example, if you make your first Roth contribution for tax year 2024 (even if you make it in early 2025 before the filing deadline), the 5-year period begins January 1, 2024, and ends December 31, 2028. After that date, distributions of earnings can be qualified if a qualifying event also occurs.</p>

          <p>For Roth conversions, each conversion has its own 5-year clock for purposes of the 10% early withdrawal penalty on the converted amount (not for determining whether earnings are tax-free). This is an important distinction that the exam may test.</p>

          <h3>No Required Minimum Distributions</h3>

          <p>One of the most significant advantages of the Roth IRA is that there are <strong>no required minimum distributions (RMDs)</strong> during the account owner's lifetime. This allows the account to grow tax-free for as long as the owner lives, making it an excellent estate planning tool. However, beneficiaries who inherit a Roth IRA are subject to distribution rules (generally the 10-year rule under the SECURE Act for non-spouse beneficiaries).</p>

          <h3>Roth Conversions</h3>

          <p>Anyone can convert a Traditional IRA (or other pre-tax retirement account) to a Roth IRA, regardless of income level. The converted amount is treated as ordinary income in the year of conversion and is fully taxable. However, the 10% early withdrawal penalty does not apply to conversions. After conversion, the funds grow tax-free and can be distributed tax-free once the 5-year rule and a qualifying event are satisfied.</p>

          <p>Converting to a Roth can be a smart strategy when you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, when tax rates are temporarily low, or when you want to avoid RMDs. The decision should consider the tax bill in the conversion year versus the long-term benefit of tax-free growth.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: Employer-Sponsored Plans ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="employer-sponsored-plans">
          <h2>Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans</h2>

          <p>Employer-sponsored retirement plans are a cornerstone of retirement savings in the United States. These plans allow employees to save for retirement with significant tax advantages, and many employers match a portion of employee contributions. The Series 7 exam tests your knowledge of the major types of employer plans, including their contribution limits, vesting schedules, and distribution rules.</p>

          <h3>401(k) Plans</h3>

          <p>The <strong>401(k) plan</strong> is the most common employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plan for private-sector employees. Named after Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, it allows employees to defer a portion of their salary into a retirement account on a pre-tax basis (or after-tax for Roth 401(k) contributions).</p>

          <h4>Employee Deferrals</h4>

          <p>For 2024, employees can defer up to <strong>$23,000</strong> of their salary into a 401(k) plan. Employees aged 50 and older can make an additional <strong>$7,500 catch-up contribution</strong>, for a total of $30,500. Pre-tax deferrals reduce the employee's taxable income in the year of contribution. For example, an employee earning $80,000 who defers $23,000 is only taxed on $57,000 of income for that year.</p>

          <h4>Employer Matching Contributions</h4>

          <p>Many employers offer a <strong>matching contribution</strong> — a percentage of the employee's deferral that the employer contributes to the plan. Common match formulas include 50% of the first 6% of salary deferred (meaning if you contribute 6%, the employer adds 3%) or dollar-for-dollar up to 3%. Employer matching contributions are always pre-tax and are subject to the overall contribution limit of <strong>$69,000</strong> (employee + employer combined, for 2024) or $76,500 for those 50+.</p>

          <h4>Vesting Schedules</h4>

          <p><strong>Vesting</strong> determines how much of the employer's contributions (including matching contributions) the employee owns if they leave the company before retirement. Employee deferrals are <strong>always 100% vested immediately</strong>. Employer contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cliff vesting:</strong> The employee becomes 100% vested after a specific period (up to 3 years). Before that period, they own 0% of employer contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Graded vesting:</strong> The employee gradually becomes vested over a period (up to 6 years). For example, 20% per year starting in year 2.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Loan Provisions</h4>

          <p>Many 401(k) plans allow participants to borrow from their account balance. The maximum loan is the <strong>lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the vested balance</strong>. Loans must be repaid within 5 years (unless the loan is used to purchase a primary residence, which may have a longer repayment period). Loan repayments are made with after-tax dollars through payroll deduction. If the participant fails to repay the loan (including upon separation from service), the outstanding balance is treated as a taxable distribution and may be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.</p>

          <h4>Hardship Withdrawals</h4>

          <p>A <strong>hardship withdrawal</strong> may be permitted if the employee demonstrates an immediate and heavy financial need. Qualifying hardship reasons include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Medical expenses for the employee, spouse, or dependents</li>
            <li>Purchase of a principal residence</li>
            <li>Tuition and educational fees for the next 12 months</li>
            <li>Prevention of eviction or mortgage foreclosure</li>
            <li>Funeral expenses</li>
            <li>Certain home repair expenses from casualty loss</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Hardship withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and the 10% early withdrawal penalty (if under 59 1/2). Unlike loans, they do not have to be repaid.</p>

          <h3>403(b) Plans</h3>

          <p>A <strong>403(b) plan</strong>, also known as a Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA), is the equivalent of a 401(k) for employees of <strong>public schools, tax-exempt organizations (501(c)(3) nonprofits), and certain ministers</strong>. The contribution limits mirror those of a 401(k): $23,000 employee deferral ($30,500 with catch-up). Investment options in 403(b) plans are typically limited to <strong>annuity contracts and mutual funds</strong>.</p>

          <p>An additional catch-up provision is available for 403(b) participants with 15 or more years of service at the same qualifying organization, allowing an extra $3,000 per year (up to a $15,000 lifetime maximum) on top of the regular catch-up contribution.</p>

          <h3>457 Plans</h3>

          <p>The <strong>457(b) plan</strong> is available to employees of <strong>state and local governments</strong> and certain non-governmental tax-exempt organizations. The contribution limit is $23,000 ($30,500 with catch-up). A unique feature of 457(b) plans is that there is <strong>no 10% early withdrawal penalty</strong> for distributions taken before age 59 1/2, though ordinary income tax still applies. This makes them attractive for those planning early retirement. Employees can contribute to both a 457(b) and a 401(k) or 403(b) simultaneously, effectively doubling their tax-deferred savings.</p>

          <h3>SEP IRAs</h3>

          <p>A <strong>Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA</strong> is a retirement plan designed primarily for <strong>self-employed individuals and small business owners</strong>. Only the employer (or self-employed individual) makes contributions — there are no employee deferrals. The employer can contribute up to <strong>25% of each eligible employee's compensation</strong>, up to a maximum of <strong>$69,000</strong> for 2024. Contributions are immediately 100% vested. SEP IRAs are simple to set up and administer, requiring minimal paperwork (IRS Form 5305-SEP).</p>

          <p>All eligible employees must receive contributions at the same percentage rate as the owner. This means if the owner contributes 15% for themselves, they must contribute 15% for every eligible employee as well.</p>

          <h3>SIMPLE IRAs</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA</strong> is designed for small businesses with <strong>100 or fewer employees</strong>. Both employees and employers contribute. Employees can defer up to <strong>$16,000</strong> ($19,500 with catch-up for 50+). The employer must make either a <strong>matching contribution of up to 3%</strong> of each participating employee's compensation, or a <strong>non-elective 2% contribution</strong> for all eligible employees regardless of participation.</p>

          <p>An important penalty rule applies to SIMPLE IRAs: withdrawals taken within the <strong>first 2 years of participation</strong> are subject to a <strong>25% early withdrawal penalty</strong> (instead of the usual 10%). After 2 years, the standard 10% penalty applies to distributions before age 59 1/2.</p>

This higher penalty exists to discourage employees from using the SIMPLE IRA as a short-term savings vehicle.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: Pension Plans and ERISA ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="pension-plans-erisa">
          <h2>Pension Plans: Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution</h2>

          <p>Retirement plans are broadly categorized as either <strong>defined benefit</strong> or <strong>defined contribution</strong> plans. Understanding the distinction is essential for the Series 7 exam.</p>

          <h3>Defined Benefit Plans</h3>

          <p>A <strong>defined benefit (DB) plan</strong> — the traditional pension — promises the employee a specific, predetermined benefit at retirement. The benefit is typically calculated based on a formula that considers factors such as years of service, average salary, and a benefit percentage. For example, a plan might pay 1.5% of the average salary for the last 5 years of service multiplied by the number of years employed.</p>

          <p>The employer bears the <strong>investment risk</strong> in a defined benefit plan. If the plan's investments underperform, the employer must make up the shortfall. The employer is responsible for making sufficient contributions to fund the promised benefits. DB plans are insured by the <strong>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)</strong>, a federal agency that protects participants if the plan sponsor cannot meet its pension obligations.</p>

          <h3>Defined Contribution Plans</h3>

          <p>A <strong>defined contribution (DC) plan</strong> specifies the amount of contributions that will be made to the plan, but the retirement benefit depends on investment performance. Examples include 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and profit-sharing plans. The <strong>employee bears the investment risk</strong> — if investments perform well, the retirement fund grows; if they perform poorly, the employee receives less.</p>

          <p>DC plans are NOT insured by the PBGC. The account balance at retirement depends entirely on contributions made and investment returns earned.</p>

              Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution — Investment Risk
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The fundamental distinction that the Series 7 exam tests is: <strong>Who bears the investment risk?</strong></p>
              <p>In a <strong>defined benefit plan</strong>, the <strong>employer</strong> bears the investment risk. The employer promises a specific benefit and must ensure the plan is adequately funded to deliver on that promise. If the plan's investments lose value, the employer must increase contributions to make up the difference. This is why defined benefit plans are increasingly rare — the financial obligation can be enormous.</p>
              <p>In a <strong>defined contribution plan</strong>, the <strong>employee</strong> bears the investment risk. The employer defines its contribution (which may include matching), but the ultimate value of the employee's retirement account depends entirely on how the investments perform. There is no guaranteed payout. The employee typically chooses from a menu of investment options within the plan.</p>
              <p>This distinction is a frequently asked question on the exam. Remember: <strong>DB = employer risk, DC = employee risk</strong>.</p>

          <h3>ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</strong> is federal legislation that sets minimum standards for most private-sector retirement plans. ERISA was enacted to protect participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans. Key ERISA provisions include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fiduciary responsibility:</strong> Plan fiduciaries must act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries, with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence of a prudent person.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting and disclosure:</strong> Plans must provide participants with information about the plan's features, funding, and management, including a Summary Plan Description (SPD).</li>
            <li><strong>Vesting:</strong> ERISA establishes minimum vesting schedules (cliff or graded) for employer contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Defined benefit plans must be adequately funded.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan termination insurance:</strong> The PBGC insures defined benefit plans.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>ERISA covers most private-sector employer-sponsored plans. It does NOT cover government plans (federal, state, or local), church plans, or plans maintained outside the United States for non-resident aliens. IRAs are also not subject to ERISA.</p>

              <p>ERISA applies to <strong>private-sector employer plans</strong> only. It does NOT cover government or church plans. The PBGC insures only <strong>defined benefit plans</strong> (not defined contribution plans). ERISA's fiduciary standard — acting in the best interest of participants — is the highest standard of care in retirement plan management.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 5: Rollovers and Transfers ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="rollovers-transfers">
          <h2>Rollover Rules and Transfers</h2>

          <p>When an employee leaves a job or wants to move retirement funds between accounts, understanding the rules for rollovers and transfers is critical. The Series 7 exam tests your knowledge of these rules in detail.</p>

          <h3>Direct Transfer (Trustee-to-Trustee)</h3>

          <p>A <strong>direct transfer</strong> (also called a trustee-to-trustee transfer) moves funds directly from one retirement plan or IRA to another without the account owner ever taking possession of the money. There is <strong>no mandatory tax withholding</strong>, no taxable event, and <strong>no limit on the number of direct transfers</strong> per year. This is the preferred method for moving retirement assets.</p>

          <h3>60-Day Rollover (Indirect Rollover)</h3>

          <p>In an <strong>indirect rollover</strong>, the account owner receives a distribution check and must deposit the funds into another qualified plan or IRA within <strong>60 days</strong>. If the funds are not deposited within 60 days, the distribution is treated as a taxable event, subject to income tax and potentially the 10% early withdrawal penalty.</p>

          <p>Critical rules for indirect rollovers:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>20% mandatory withholding:</strong> When funds are distributed from an employer-sponsored plan (like a 401(k)) for an indirect rollover, the plan is required to withhold 20% for federal income tax. The account owner must come up with the withheld amount from other sources to roll over the full amount. If they only roll over what they received (80%), the 20% that was withheld is treated as a taxable distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Once-per-year rule:</strong> You can only do one indirect rollover between IRAs in a 12-month period. This applies in aggregate to all your Traditional and Roth IRAs. Direct transfers are not subject to this rule.</li>
            <li><strong>Same property rule:</strong> The same property distributed must be rolled over (you cannot sell securities, roll over cash, and rebuy).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Permissible Rollovers</h3>

          <p>Generally, you can roll over funds between the following types of accounts:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Traditional IRA to Traditional IRA</li>
            <li>401(k) to Traditional IRA (most common upon job change)</li>
            <li>401(k) to new employer's 401(k) (if the new plan accepts rollovers)</li>
            <li>Traditional IRA to Roth IRA (conversion — taxable event)</li>
            <li>403(b) to IRA or 401(k)</li>
            <li>457(b) to IRA or 401(k)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> roll a Roth IRA into a Traditional IRA, nor can you roll a Roth IRA into a pre-tax employer plan. Pre-tax money can be converted to Roth (taxable), but the reverse is not possible.</p>

              <p>The Series 7 loves to test the difference between a <strong>direct transfer</strong> and a <strong>60-day rollover</strong>. Always recommend a direct transfer — no tax withholding, no deadline, and no limit on frequency. With a 60-day rollover from an employer plan, 20% is mandatorily withheld, and the individual must replace that 20% from personal funds to avoid it being a taxable distribution.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 6: Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Plans ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="qualified-nonqualified">
          <h2>Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Plans</h2>

          <p>Retirement plans are classified as either <strong>qualified</strong> or <strong>non-qualified</strong>, which determines their tax treatment and regulatory requirements.</p>

          <h3>Qualified Plans</h3>

          <p>A <strong>qualified plan</strong> meets the requirements of IRC Section 401(a) and receives favorable tax treatment. Benefits include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Employer contributions are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> to the employer</li>
            <li>Contributions grow <strong>tax-deferred</strong> for the employee</li>
            <li>Must meet <strong>non-discrimination requirements</strong> — cannot disproportionately favor highly compensated employees</li>
            <li>Must comply with ERISA requirements (vesting, funding, reporting)</li>
            <li>Must be established for the <strong>exclusive benefit</strong> of employees</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Examples of qualified plans: 401(k), defined benefit pension, profit-sharing plans, money purchase plans, Keogh plans (for self-employed individuals).</p>

          <h3>Non-Qualified Plans</h3>

          <p>A <strong>non-qualified plan</strong> does not meet IRC Section 401(a) requirements and does not receive the same tax benefits. However, non-qualified plans offer employers more flexibility. Key characteristics:</p>

              Keogh Plans (HR-10 Plans)
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p><strong>Keogh plans</strong> (also called HR-10 plans) are qualified retirement plans for <strong>self-employed individuals</strong> and their employees. They can be structured as defined benefit or defined contribution plans. The term "Keogh" is somewhat outdated as the tax code now treats self-employed retirement plans the same as corporate plans, but the term still appears on the Series 7 exam.</p>
              <p>Key points about Keogh plans:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Available to sole proprietors, partners, and members of LLCs taxed as partnerships</li>
                <li>Contributions based on <strong>net self-employment income</strong> (after deducting the employer portion of self-employment tax)</li>
                <li>Must cover all eligible employees if the business has employees</li>
                <li>Must be established by December 31 of the tax year (though contributions can be made until the tax filing deadline)</li>
                <li>Subject to ERISA requirements, including vesting schedules for employees</li>

            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">1. At what age must a Traditional IRA owner begin taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) 59 1/2</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) 65</button>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Under the SECURE 2.0 Act, RMDs must begin by April 1 of the year following the year the account owner turns 73. The RMD age was previously 72 (under the original SECURE Act) and 70 1/2 before that. Roth IRAs have no RMD requirement during the owner's lifetime.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">2. Which of the following is TRUE about Roth IRA contributions?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) They are tax-deductible</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) They can be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free at any time</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) They are subject to income limits only if the taxpayer has an employer plan</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) They must remain in the account for at least 5 years before any withdrawal</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so they can be withdrawn at any time without tax or penalty. The 5-year rule and qualifying event requirements apply only to the earnings portion of distributions. Roth IRA contributions are subject to income limits regardless of employer plan participation.

            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">3. An employee takes an indirect rollover from her 401(k). How much will be withheld for federal taxes?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) 10%</button>

              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) No withholding is required</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              When funds are distributed from an employer-sponsored plan for an indirect (60-day) rollover, 20% mandatory federal tax withholding applies. The employee must replace the withheld amount from other sources to roll over the full balance. This withholding does NOT apply to direct (trustee-to-trustee) transfers.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">4. In a defined benefit pension plan, who bears the investment risk?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) The employer</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) The employee</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) The PBGC</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Both the employer and employee equally</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              In a defined benefit plan, the employer bears the investment risk because it has promised a specific benefit at retirement. If the plan's investments underperform, the employer must make up the shortfall. In a defined contribution plan, the employee bears the risk. The PBGC insures DB plans but does not bear the investment risk during the plan's operation.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">5. A participant in a SIMPLE IRA withdraws funds 18 months after opening the account. What early withdrawal penalty applies?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) No penalty</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) 10%</button>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              SIMPLE IRA distributions taken within the first 2 years of participation are subject to a 25% early withdrawal penalty (rather than the standard 10%). Since 18 months is within the 2-year window, the 25% penalty applies. After the 2-year period, the standard 10% penalty applies to distributions before age 59 1/2.
