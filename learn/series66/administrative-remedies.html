        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Administrator Powers ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="administrator-powers">
          <h2>Powers and Authority of the Administrator</h2>

          <p>The state securities Administrator serves as the chief enforcement officer under the Uniform Securities Act, wielding broad powers to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Understanding the scope and limits of the Administrator's authority is essential for Series 66 candidates, as these enforcement provisions are heavily tested and form the backbone of state securities regulation.</p>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 401</strong> of the USA, the Administrator has comprehensive authority to administer and enforce the Act within the state. This includes rulemaking, investigative, and enforcement powers. The Administrator's actions are subject to judicial review, ensuring proper checks and balances on regulatory authority.</p>

          <h3>Investigative and Examination Powers</h3>

          <p>The Administrator may conduct investigations <strong>within or outside the state</strong> to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate the Act. This investigative authority is proactive — the Administrator need not wait for a formal complaint before initiating an investigation.</p>

          <p>Key investigative powers include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Issuing subpoenas:</strong> The Administrator can compel the production of books, records, documents, correspondence, and other materials relevant to an investigation. Subpoenas can be issued to persons within or outside the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Compelling testimony:</strong> The Administrator can require any person to appear and testify under oath regarding matters under investigation. Testimony can be taken within or outside state boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Conducting examinations:</strong> The Administrator may examine the books and records of any registered broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or IAR at any time, without advance notice. Routine compliance examinations are common.</li>
            <li><strong>Publishing information:</strong> The Administrator may publish information concerning violations when doing so is in the public interest and does not prejudice the rights of persons under investigation.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout callout--exam-tip">
            <div class="callout__header">

              <p class="callout__title">Exam Tip</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>Remember that the Administrator's investigative powers extend <strong>beyond state borders</strong>. The Administrator can investigate activities outside the state if they affect the state's residents. However, the Administrator <strong>cannot</strong> impose criminal penalties (only courts can) and <strong>cannot</strong> issue injunctions (must petition a court for injunctive relief). These limits on authority are frequently tested.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Rulemaking Authority</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 412</strong> of the USA, the Administrator has authority to make, amend, and rescind rules, forms, and orders necessary to carry out the Act's provisions. These rules have the force of law within the state and supplement the statutory provisions with detailed regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>The Administrator's rules must be adopted through proper administrative procedures (notice, comment period, publication) and cannot exceed the statutory authority granted by the Act. NASAA (North American Securities Administrators Association) provides model rules that many states adopt to promote uniformity across jurisdictions.</p>

          <h3>Cooperation with Other Regulators</h3>

          <p>The Administrator may cooperate with securities administrators in other states, the SEC, FINRA, and other regulatory bodies. This includes sharing investigative information, coordinating enforcement actions, and providing reciprocal assistance in serving subpoenas or enforcing orders. Multi-state coordination is essential for combating securities fraud that crosses jurisdictional boundaries.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: Administrative Actions ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="administrative-actions">
          <h2>Registration Actions and Administrative Orders</h2>

          <p>The Administrator has several tools available to address violations and protect investors. These administrative actions can affect registrations, impose conditions, and halt unlawful conduct. Understanding the distinctions between different types of actions is critical for exam success.</p>

          <h3>Five Types of Registration Actions</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 204</strong> (securities registration) and <strong>Section 412</strong> (person registration), the Administrator may take five distinct actions on registrations:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Deny:</strong> Refuse to grant a registration application. Denial occurs <strong>before</strong> the registration becomes effective. The Administrator denies registration when the applicant fails to meet statutory requirements or has a disqualifying condition (felony conviction within 10 years, material misstatement in application, insolvency for broker-dealers, lack of qualifications, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Revoke:</strong> Permanently terminate an existing registration. Revocation is the most severe administrative sanction and is appropriate for serious violations such as fraud, repeated violations, failure to supervise, or willful violation of the Act. A revoked registrant must reapply and may face additional conditions or permanent bars.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Suspend:</strong> Temporarily halt a registration for a specified period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, one year). Suspension is appropriate for less severe violations or when the registrant can correct the deficiency. Suspension allows for eventual reinstatement without a new application.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cancel:</strong> Remove a registration for non-punitive, administrative reasons. Cancellation applies when the registrant cannot be located, has died, has become mentally incompetent, has ceased to exist (for entities), or no longer conducts business. Cancellation is <strong>not a penalty</strong> and does not require notice and hearing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdraw:</strong> The registrant voluntarily terminates their own registration. Withdrawal becomes effective <strong>30 days</strong> after filing the application for withdrawal, unless the Administrator institutes a proceeding before that date. This prevents registrants from withdrawing to avoid pending enforcement actions.
            </li>
          </ol>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p><strong>Critical distinction:</strong> Cancellation is NOT the same as revocation. Cancellation is non-punitive (used for death, disappearance, or insolvency) and does NOT require notice and hearing. Revocation is punitive (used for violations) and DOES require notice and opportunity for hearing. Exam questions frequently test whether notice and hearing are required for different actions.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Prior Notice and Opportunity for Hearing</h3>

          <p>For punitive actions (denial, suspension, revocation), the Administrator must generally provide <strong>prior notice and opportunity for a hearing</strong> under <strong>Section 412(d)</strong> of the USA. This satisfies due process requirements and allows the affected person to present their defense before sanctions are imposed.</p>

          <p>However, the Administrator may issue a <strong>summary order</strong> (effective immediately, without prior notice or hearing) when:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Administrator finds that <strong>the public interest</strong> requires immediate action, AND</li>
            <li>The Administrator finds that the <strong>delay</strong> caused by a hearing would be <strong>harmful to investors</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Even with a summary order, the Administrator must <strong>promptly notify</strong> the affected person and provide an <strong>opportunity for a hearing after</strong> the order takes effect. Summary orders allow the Administrator to act quickly against ongoing fraud or imminent harm while still preserving hearing rights.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: Cease and Desist Orders ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="cease-and-desist">
          <h2>Cease and Desist Orders</h2>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 412(d)</strong> of the USA, the Administrator has the power to issue <strong>cease and desist orders</strong> to any person engaging in conduct that violates the Act. A cease and desist order immediately prohibits the specified conduct and is one of the Administrator's most powerful enforcement tools.</p>

          <h3>When Cease and Desist Orders Are Used</h3>

          <p>The Administrator may issue cease and desist orders to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Stop ongoing violations (selling unregistered securities, operating without registration, making fraudulent statements)</li>
            <li>Prevent imminent violations (when the Administrator has evidence that a person is about to engage in a violation)</li>
            <li>Halt unlawful business practices (churning, unauthorized trading, misleading advertising)</li>
            <li>Protect investors from immediate and ongoing harm</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cease and desist orders can be directed at <strong>any person</strong>, not just registered persons. This allows the Administrator to act against unregistered individuals or entities engaging in securities activities within the state.</p>

          <h3>Summary vs. Post-Hearing Orders</h3>

          <p>The Administrator may issue a cease and desist order in two ways:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>After notice and hearing:</strong> The Administrator provides the respondent with notice, conducts a hearing, and issues the order based on findings. This is the standard process.</li>
            <li><strong>On a summary basis (temporary order):</strong> When immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest, the Administrator may issue a temporary cease and desist order without prior notice or hearing. The order takes effect immediately, but the Administrator must promptly schedule a hearing to determine whether the order should be made permanent.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout callout--definition">
            <div class="callout__header">
              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><path d="M12 16v-4"/><path d="M12 8h.01"/></svg></div>
              <p class="callout__title">Definition</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p><strong>Cease and Desist Order:</strong> An administrative order issued by the state securities Administrator directing a person to immediately stop engaging in specified conduct that violates the Uniform Securities Act. It is an administrative remedy (not a court order) but violation can lead to court enforcement proceedings, including contempt charges.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Distinction from Injunctions</h3>

          <p>A cease and desist order is different from an injunction. The Administrator can issue cease and desist orders directly using administrative authority. An <strong>injunction</strong> is a court order, and the Administrator must petition a court under <strong>Section 408</strong> to obtain injunctive relief. Both serve to halt violations, but injunctions carry the full contempt power of the court.</p>

          <p>If a person violates a cease and desist order, the Administrator may seek court enforcement, which can result in fines, contempt charges, and imprisonment (by the court, not the Administrator).</p>
        </section>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: Sanctions and Penalties ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="sanctions-penalties">
          <h2>Administrative Sanctions and Penalties</h2>

          <p>Beyond registration actions and cease and desist orders, the Administrator may impose various sanctions and conditions to address violations and deter future misconduct. These remedies are available under <strong>Section 412</strong> of the USA.</p>

          <h3>Monetary Penalties and Disgorgement</h3>

          <p>The Administrator may assess <strong>administrative fines</strong> for violations of the Act. While specific fine amounts vary by state, many states following NASAA guidelines authorize fines of up to <strong>$10,000 per violation</strong>. Some states have significantly higher limits, particularly for egregious or repeated violations.</p>

          <p>The Administrator may also order <strong>disgorgement</strong> of profits obtained through violations. Disgorgement requires the violator to return ill-gotten gains, preventing unjust enrichment. This remedy is particularly effective against schemes where the violator profited substantially from illegal conduct.</p>

          <h3>Conditions and Limitations</h3>

          <p>Rather than denying or revoking a registration outright, the Administrator may impose <strong>conditions or limitations</strong> on registration, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Restrictions on the types of securities that may be offered or sold</li>
            <li>Requirements for additional supervision or compliance procedures</li>
            <li>Limitations on compensation arrangements</li>
            <li>Periodic reporting requirements</li>
            <li>Mandatory training or continuing education</li>
            <li>Prohibition from supervising other agents or representatives</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These conditions allow the Administrator to tailor remedies to specific violations and registrants, providing flexibility between outright denial or revocation and allowing continued registration with safeguards.</p>

          <h3>Stop Orders on Securities Registrations</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 306</strong>, the Administrator may issue a <strong>stop order</strong> suspending or denying effectiveness of a securities registration statement. Stop orders prevent the sale of securities when the registration contains material misstatements, omissions, or when the offering would constitute fraud.</p>

          <p>The Administrator may issue stop orders before or after the registration becomes effective. Like other administrative actions, stop orders generally require prior notice and hearing unless summary action is necessary for immediate investor protection.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 5: Civil Liability ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="civil-liability">
          <h2>Civil Liability and Private Rights of Action</h2>

          <p>The USA creates private civil remedies that allow injured investors to sue for violations and recover their losses. These provisions, found in <strong>Section 410</strong> (civil liability for unregistered sales) and <strong>Section 509</strong> (civil liability for fraud), are among the most important investor protections in the Act.</p>

          <h3>Civil Liability for Registration Violations</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 410(a)</strong>, any person who offers or sells a security in violation of the registration requirements is liable to the purchaser. This applies to selling unregistered, non-exempt securities or selling without proper person registration (unlicensed broker-dealer or agent).</p>

          <p>The buyer may recover:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>consideration paid</strong> for the security</li>
            <li><strong>Plus interest</strong> from the date of purchase (typically 6% per annum, though state-specific rates vary)</li>
            <li><strong>Minus any income received</strong> on the security (dividends, interest)</li>
            <li><strong>Minus the current value</strong> (if the buyer still owns the security)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the buyer no longer owns the security, recovery is the <strong>purchase price minus the sale price</strong>, plus interest. This is the remedy of <strong>rescission</strong> — the buyer can essentially "undo" the transaction and recover their investment.</p>

          <h3>Civil Liability for Fraud</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 410(a)(2)</strong>, any person who offers or sells a security by means of an untrue statement of material fact or an omission of material fact is liable to the purchaser. This civil fraud remedy parallels the criminal and administrative fraud provisions but provides direct recovery for the injured investor.</p>

          <p>Critically, the burden of proof is shifted in fraud cases: the <strong>seller has the burden</strong> of proving that they <strong>did NOT know</strong>, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the misrepresentation or omission. This makes it easier for investors to prevail in civil fraud actions.</p>

          <h3>Statute of Limitations for Civil Actions</h3>

          <p>Civil actions under the USA must be commenced within the <strong>earlier of</strong>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>2 years</strong> after discovery of the violation (or when it should have been discovered with reasonable diligence), OR</li>
            <li><strong>3 years</strong> after the sale</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The "earlier of" standard means that the <strong>3-year limit is absolute</strong>. Even if the investor discovers the fraud 2.5 years after the sale, they only have 6 months remaining (to reach the 3-year outer limit) to file suit, not a full 2 years from discovery.</p>

          <div class="callout callout--exam-tip">
            <div class="callout__header">
              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 2L2 7l10 5 10-5-10-5z"/><path d="M2 17l10 5 10-5"/><path d="M2 12l10 5 10-5"/></svg></div>
              <p class="callout__title">Exam Tip</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>The statute of limitations is heavily tested. Remember: <strong>2 years from discovery OR 3 years from sale, whichever comes FIRST</strong>. Example: Sale occurs January 1, 2024. Investor discovers fraud December 1, 2025. Normally 2 years from discovery would be December 1, 2027, but the 3-year outer limit expires January 1, 2027, so the deadline is January 1, 2027. Always pick the earlier date.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Tender Offer and Rescission Rights</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 410(b)</strong>, if the seller makes a <strong>tender offer</strong> to the buyer (offering to repurchase the security at the original purchase price plus interest), and the buyer refuses the offer, the buyer waives the right to sue for rescission. This encourages voluntary resolution of disputes without litigation.</p>

          <p>However, the tender offer must be made in good faith and must include the statutory interest. If the offer is insufficient or not made in good faith, the buyer retains the right to sue.</p>

          <h3>Joint and Several Liability</h3>

          <p>Multiple persons involved in a violative transaction may be held <strong>jointly and severally liable</strong>. This means the injured investor can recover the full amount from any one defendant, and that defendant may then seek contribution from other responsible parties. Joint and several liability is particularly important in underwriting and distribution chains where multiple parties participate in an unlawful sale.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 6: Criminal Penalties and Review ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="criminal-penalties">
          <h2>Criminal Penalties and Judicial Review</h2>

          <p>While administrative and civil remedies address most violations, the USA also provides for criminal prosecution of willful violations. Criminal penalties represent the most severe consequences under state securities law.</p>

          <h3>Criminal Violations and Penalties</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 508</strong> of the USA, any person who <strong>willfully</strong> violates any provision of the Act, any rule or order under the Act, or who willfully makes a false statement in a filing is guilty of a criminal offense. The key element is <strong>willfulness</strong> — the person must have acted intentionally or with reckless disregard, not merely negligently.</p>

          <p>Criminal penalties under the USA typically include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Imprisonment:</strong> Up to <strong>3 years</strong> (in some states, up to 5 years for aggravated offenses)</li>
            <li><strong>Fines:</strong> Up to <strong>$5,000</strong> per violation (some states have higher limits, such as $10,000 or more)</li>
            <li><strong>Both:</strong> The court may impose both imprisonment and fines for the same violation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that specific penalty amounts vary by state, but the NASAA model is generally 3 years imprisonment and $5,000 fines. The Series 66 exam tests the model statute provisions.</p>

          <h3>Who Can Bring Criminal Charges?</h3>

          <p>Criminal prosecutions are brought by the <strong>state's prosecuting authority</strong> (typically the state attorney general or district attorney), <strong>NOT by the Administrator</strong>. The Administrator's role is to investigate violations, refer cases to prosecutors, and provide evidence and cooperation during the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Administrator <strong>cannot</strong> impose criminal penalties directly. Only a court, following prosecution by the appropriate criminal authority, can impose imprisonment or criminal fines.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p><strong>The Administrator can NEVER impose criminal penalties.</strong> The Administrator cannot imprison anyone or impose criminal fines. Criminal prosecution requires court proceedings initiated by the state's prosecuting authority. This distinction is frequently tested. The Administrator investigates and refers; prosecutors charge and try; courts convict and sentence.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Criminal Statute of Limitations</h3>

          <p>Criminal prosecutions must generally be commenced within <strong>5 years</strong> after the offense was committed. This is longer than the civil statute of limitations (2/3 years) because criminal cases often require more extensive investigation and have a higher burden of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>

          <h3>Parallel Proceedings</h3>

          <p>A single violation can result in <strong>administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings simultaneously</strong>. These proceedings are independent:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Administrator can revoke a registration and impose fines (administrative)</li>
            <li>The injured investor can sue for rescission and damages (civil)</li>
            <li>The state attorney general can prosecute criminally (criminal)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The outcomes are independent. Acquittal in a criminal case (failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) does not prevent the Administrator from revoking a registration (preponderance of evidence standard) or the investor from recovering in a civil lawsuit (preponderance standard, with burden shifted to seller in fraud cases).</p>

          <h3>Judicial Review of Administrator Orders</h3>

          <p>Under <strong>Section 410</strong> of the USA, any person aggrieved by an order of the Administrator has the right to seek <strong>judicial review</strong> in the appropriate state court. This right ensures that the Administrator's decisions are subject to independent oversight.</p>

          <p>Key aspects of judicial review:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> The petition for review must be filed within a specified period (typically <strong>60 days</strong>) after the Administrator's order is entered.</li>
            <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Review is typically sought in the state court located in the county where the Administrator's office is located or where the petitioner resides.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard of review:</strong> The court reviews whether the Administrator's order is supported by <strong>substantial evidence</strong> and whether the Administrator acted within statutory authority. The court gives deference to the Administrator's factual findings but reviews legal conclusions independently.</li>
            <li><strong>No automatic stay:</strong> Filing a petition for judicial review does <strong>NOT</strong> automatically suspend the Administrator's order. The order remains in effect unless the court specifically grants a stay pending review.</li>
          </ul>

              Multi-Level Enforcement Framework
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The USA creates a three-tiered enforcement system designed to address violations at multiple levels with appropriate remedies for each:</p>

              <p><strong>Administrative Level:</strong> The Administrator uses administrative tools (deny, suspend, revoke registrations; cease and desist orders; fines; conditions) to quickly address violations and protect investors. Administrative proceedings use a preponderance of evidence standard and are conducted by the Administrator. These actions can be taken swiftly, often on a summary basis when necessary. Administrative penalties cannot include imprisonment.</p>

              <p><strong>Civil Level:</strong> Injured investors can sue for rescission or damages under Section 410. Civil actions use a preponderance of evidence standard, but the burden is shifted to the seller in fraud cases (seller must prove they didn't know and couldn't have known). The Administrator can also petition courts for injunctions under Section 408. Civil remedies focus on making the investor whole and preventing ongoing violations. The statute of limitations is 2 years from discovery or 3 years from sale, whichever is earlier.</p>

              <p><strong>Criminal Level:</strong> The state attorney general or district attorney prosecutes willful violations. Criminal proceedings require proof beyond a reasonable doubt and can result in imprisonment (up to 3 years) and fines (up to $5,000). Criminal prosecution is reserved for the most egregious cases involving intentional misconduct. The statute of limitations is 5 years from the offense.</p>

              <p>These three levels operate independently. A single act of securities fraud can trigger all three simultaneously: the Administrator revokes the perpetrator's registration and imposes administrative fines; the victim sues for rescission under Section 410; and the attorney general prosecutes criminally. The outcomes in each proceeding are independent — acquittal in the criminal case (highest burden of proof) does not prevent administrative sanctions or civil recovery (lower burdens of proof).</p>

              <p>For the Series 66 exam, remember: (1) Administrative actions are by the Administrator alone, no criminal penalties, can be summary; (2) Civil actions are by investors or Administrator seeking injunctions, compensatory focus, burden shifted in fraud; (3) Criminal actions are by prosecutor, willful conduct required, highest penalties and proof burden.</p>

              Cancellation is a non-punitive administrative action used when the registrant has died, cannot be located, or has become incompetent. It does not require notice and hearing because it is not a penalty. Denial, revocation, and suspension are punitive actions that require prior notice and opportunity for hearing (though summary orders can be issued in emergencies).
