        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Broker-Dealer Registration ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="broker-dealer-registration">
          <h2>Broker-Dealer Registration Requirements</h2>

          <p>Under the Uniform Securities Act, a <strong>broker-dealer</strong> must register in each state where it conducts securities business. The registration process involves filing an application with the state Administrator, paying the required fees, meeting minimum financial requirements (net capital), posting a surety bond if required, and filing a consent to service of process. The registration becomes effective at noon on the 30th day after the application is filed, unless the Administrator issues an earlier effective date or denies the application.</p>

          <p>The registration is effective from the date it becomes effective until <strong>December 31 of that year</strong>. Registrations must be renewed annually. The renewal process typically requires the filing of updated information, payment of the renewal fee, and any required financial statements. If a broker-dealer fails to renew its registration by the expiration date, it can no longer legally conduct securities business in the state.</p>

              <p class="callout__title">Definition</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p><strong>Broker-Dealer:</strong> Any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others (acting as broker) or for its own account (acting as dealer). Under the USA, BDs must register in each state where they conduct business. The firm itself registers as a BD; its individual representatives register as agents.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Application Requirements</h3>

          <p>The broker-dealer registration application (typically filed through the Central Registration Depository, or CRD, operated by FINRA) must include the applicant's form and place of organization, proposed method of doing business, qualifications and business history of the applicant and its principals (for the past 10 years), any injunctions or administrative orders, any criminal convictions, any pending litigation, current financial condition (including a balance sheet), and any additional information the Administrator may require.</p>

          <p>The Administrator may also require that the applicant pass an examination (although in practice, the FINRA registration exams serve this purpose). The Administrator can impose conditions on the registration, require the posting of a surety bond, or require minimum net capital. If the applicant or any of its control persons has been the subject of adverse regulatory actions, the Administrator may deny the registration.</p>

          <h3>Exclusions from the Broker-Dealer Definition</h3>

          <p>As discussed in Chapter 1, certain persons are excluded from the definition of broker-dealer. These exclusions mean the person does not need to register as a BD, regardless of their activities. The key exclusions are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agents</strong> (individuals who represent BDs are not themselves BDs)</li>
            <li><strong>Issuers</strong> (companies selling their own securities)</li>
            <li><strong>Banks, savings institutions, and trust companies</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Persons with no place of business in the state</strong> who effect transactions only with other BDs, institutional buyers, or existing clients who are temporarily in the state but are not state residents</li>
          </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>The "no place of business" exclusion for broker-dealers is heavily tested. A BD with no office in the state does NOT need to register if it deals ONLY with: (1) other broker-dealers, (2) institutional investors, or (3) existing clients who are temporarily present in the state but are not residents. If the BD solicits new retail clients in the state, it must register regardless of whether it has an office there.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: Agent Registration ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="agent-registration">
          <h2>Agent Registration Requirements</h2>

          <p>An <strong>agent</strong> is any individual who represents a broker-dealer or issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities. Agents must register in each state where they conduct securities activities. An agent's registration is linked to the employing broker-dealer or issuer. If the agent changes firms, the agent must re-register under the new firm's registration.</p>

          <p>The agent registration process typically involves filing Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration) through the CRD system. The application must include the individual's personal information, employment history for the past 10 years, disciplinary history, criminal history, financial disclosures (including bankruptcies and unsatisfied judgments), and any other information required by the Administrator.</p>

          <h3>When an Agent Must Register</h3>

          <p>An agent must register in a state when the agent represents a broker-dealer and effects transactions with persons in that state. The key factors are where the clients are located and whether the agent is actively soliciting business in the state. An agent's registration, like a BD's registration, expires on December 31 and must be renewed annually.</p>

          <p>When an agent leaves one broker-dealer and joins another, the agent's registration with the first firm is automatically terminated, and the agent must apply for a new registration with the new firm. There is typically no gap in registration if the agent transitions promptly, as many states allow the new registration to become effective immediately upon proper filing.</p>

          <h3>Exclusions from the Agent Definition</h3>

          <p>The following individuals are excluded from the definition of agent and do not need to register:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Individuals representing issuers in transactions involving exempt securities</strong> (such as government bonds, municipal securities, or bank securities)</li>
            <li><strong>Individuals representing issuers in exempt transactions</strong> (such as private placements with institutional investors)</li>
            <li><strong>Individuals representing issuers in transactions with employees, partners, or directors</strong> where no commission is specifically paid for solicitation</li>
            <li><strong>Clerical and administrative personnel</strong> of a broker-dealer who do not effect transactions or provide investment advice</li>
          </ul>

If an individual represents a BD that is not registered in a state, the agent's registration in that state is also invalid.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: Successor Registration ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="successor-registration">
          <h2>Successor Registration</h2>

          <p>A <strong>successor firm</strong> is a broker-dealer or investment adviser that acquires or succeeds to the business of another registered broker-dealer or investment adviser. The USA provides for successor registration to ensure continuity of business when a firm undergoes a corporate restructuring, merger, acquisition, or change of control.</p>

          <p>Under the USA, a successor firm may automatically succeed to the registration of the predecessor firm if the succession is the result of a change in the form of business organization (such as converting from a partnership to a corporation, or from an LLC to a corporation). The successor must promptly file an application for registration, and the predecessor's registration remains effective until the Administrator processes the new application or for a period specified by rule.</p>

          <p>This automatic succession does not apply if the successor represents a fundamentally different business or if the Administrator determines that the public interest requires a new review. In such cases, the successor must apply for a new registration from scratch. The Administrator retains the authority to deny the successor registration if there are grounds for denial under the USA.</p>

              <p>ABC Securities, LLC is a state-registered broker-dealer that decides to reorganize as ABC Securities, Inc. (converting from an LLC to a corporation). Under the successor registration provision, ABC Securities, Inc. may automatically succeed to the registration of ABC Securities, LLC. The firm must file a new application promptly, but it can continue operating under the predecessor's registration until the Administrator acts on the new application. However, if XYZ Capital acquires ABC Securities and plans to operate it under a completely different business model, the successor registration may not be automatic, and a new application may be required.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: Denial, Suspension, and Revocation ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="denial-suspension-revocation">
          <h2>Denial, Suspension, and Revocation of Registration</h2>

          <p>The Administrator has the authority to <strong>deny, suspend, revoke, cancel, or withdraw</strong> the registration of any broker-dealer or agent. The grounds for such action include violations of the USA or its rules, filing false or misleading information on an application, having been convicted of a securities-related felony within the past 10 years, being subject to an injunction by a court involving securities activities, being the subject of an adverse order by another securities regulator, engaging in dishonest or unethical business practices, being insolvent, or failing to meet the qualification requirements.</p>

          <p>Before denying, suspending, or revoking a registration, the Administrator must provide:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Prior notice</strong> of the proposed action</li>
            <li><strong>An opportunity for hearing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Written findings of fact and conclusions of law</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>However, if the Administrator finds that the public interest requires immediate action, the Administrator may <strong>summarily postpone or suspend</strong> a registration pending a hearing. In such cases, the hearing must be scheduled promptly after the summary action is taken. The respondent has the right to request judicial review of any adverse administrative action.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>The Administrator's power to deny, suspend, or revoke BD and agent registrations is broad but not unlimited. Due process protections (notice, hearing, written findings) are required for all adverse actions. Summary suspensions are only permitted when the public interest demands immediate action, and a hearing must be promptly scheduled. The Administrator may also impose conditions on registrations, such as requiring additional supervision, net capital, or surety bonds.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Withdrawal of Registration</h3>

          <p>A broker-dealer or agent may voluntarily <strong>withdraw</strong> its registration by filing a notice of withdrawal with the Administrator. The withdrawal becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the Administrator (or later if the Administrator has commenced a proceeding against the registrant). A withdrawal does not protect the registrant from actions based on conduct that occurred while the registration was in effect. The Administrator may institute proceedings against a former registrant for violations that occurred during the period of registration.</p>

              The Canadian Broker-Dealer Exemption
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The USA provides a special exemption for certain Canadian broker-dealers. A Canadian broker-dealer may be exempt from state registration if it has no office or physical presence in the state and its only clients in the state are Canadian citizens temporarily residing there. This exemption recognizes the integrated nature of North American securities markets and the regulatory oversight provided by Canadian securities regulators.</p>

              <p>To qualify, the Canadian broker-dealer must be registered in its home jurisdiction in Canada, must limit its activities in the U.S. state to servicing existing Canadian clients who are temporarily present, and must not solicit new U.S. clients. The exemption is reciprocal in nature, reflecting the cooperative relationship between NASAA and Canadian securities administrators.</p>

              <p>Similarly, Canadian agents associated with exempt Canadian broker-dealers may be exempt from state registration under the same conditions. However, both the Canadian BD and its agents remain subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the USA, and the state Administrator retains full authority to investigate and prosecute any fraudulent activities.</p>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">1. A broker-dealer with no place of business in a state is exempt from registration if it transacts business exclusively with:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) Any individual investor in the state</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) Other broker-dealers and institutional investors</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) Only residents who have net worth exceeding $1 million</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Only clients referred by registered agents in the state</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              A broker-dealer with no place of business in a state is excluded from the BD definition (and thus exempt from registration) if it deals only with other broker-dealers, institutional investors, or existing clients who are temporarily in the state but are not residents. Dealing with any retail clients who are state residents triggers the registration requirement.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">2. Broker-dealer and agent registrations expire on:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) The anniversary of the effective date</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) December 31 of each year</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) June 30 of each year</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) They do not expire; they are permanent</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Under the USA, all registrations of broker-dealers, agents, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives expire on December 31 of each year and must be renewed annually. This calendar-year expiration applies regardless of when the registration first became effective.

          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">3. Before the Administrator can revoke a broker-dealer's registration, the Administrator must provide:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) Only written notice of the revocation</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) SEC approval</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">C) Prior notice, opportunity for hearing, and written findings of fact</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) A 90-day cure period</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Due process requires the Administrator to provide prior notice, an opportunity for hearing, and written findings of fact and conclusions of law before revoking a registration. SEC approval is not required. Summary suspension is only available in the public interest with a prompt subsequent hearing.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">4. An agent who changes broker-dealers must:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) Re-register under the new broker-dealer</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) Wait 30 days before working at the new firm</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) Take and pass the qualification exam again</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Obtain written approval from the Administrator</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              When an agent changes broker-dealers, the agent's registration with the former firm is terminated and the agent must apply for a new registration with the new firm. There is no waiting period required, and the agent does not need to retake qualification exams. The transition is handled through the CRD system.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">5. A successor broker-dealer may automatically succeed to a predecessor's registration when:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) The succession results from a change in the form of business organization</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) The successor purchases the predecessor's client list</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) The predecessor's registration has been revoked</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) The successor is located in a different state</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Successor registration allows automatic succession when the change is organizational (e.g., converting from an LLC to a corporation). Simply buying a client list does not constitute a succession. If the predecessor's registration was revoked, the successor cannot inherit it. The successor must promptly file a new application.
