        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Introduction to the Uniform Securities Act ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="introduction-to-the-usa">
          <h2>Introduction to the Uniform Securities Act</h2>

          <p>The Uniform Securities Act (USA) is a model statute created by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (now known as the Uniform Law Commission). It provides a framework that individual states can adopt, in whole or in part, to regulate the offer and sale of securities within their borders. The original USA was drafted in 1956, with significant revisions in 1985 and 2002. While each state may modify the act to suit its specific needs, the core principles remain consistent across jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The primary purpose of the USA is to protect investors from fraud while still facilitating legitimate securities transactions. State securities laws are often called <strong>"blue sky laws"</strong> because they aim to prevent speculative schemes that have "no more basis than so many feet of blue sky." The term dates back to the early 1900s when state legislators recognized the need to protect unsophisticated investors from promoters selling worthless investments.</p>

          <p>Every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories have their own securities statutes and regulations. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) coordinates the regulation of securities at the state level and administers the Series 63 examination to ensure that securities agents understand these state-level regulations before conducting business.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p><strong>Blue Sky Laws:</strong> A colloquial term for state securities laws designed to protect investors from fraudulent offerings. The name is believed to originate from a judicial opinion describing worthless speculative schemes as having "no more substance than so many feet of blue sky."</p>
              <p><strong>Uniform Securities Act (USA):</strong> A model statute drafted by the Uniform Law Commission that serves as the basis for most state securities laws. It provides a standardized framework for regulating securities transactions, registering persons and securities, and prohibiting fraud at the state level.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>The Role of NASAA</h3>

          <p>The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) is the oldest international organization devoted to investor protection. Founded in 1919, NASAA's membership consists of the securities administrators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and Mexico. NASAA members are the frontline regulators who investigate complaints, license firms and professionals, and enforce state securities laws.</p>

          <p>NASAA plays several important roles in the securities regulatory framework. First, it develops uniform legislation and model rules that states can adopt to promote consistency. Second, it coordinates multi-state enforcement actions against fraud. Third, it develops and administers the Series 63, Series 65, and Series 66 examinations. Fourth, it provides a platform for state regulators to share information and best practices.</p>

          <h3>Federal vs. State Regulation: The Dual Regulatory System</h3>

          <p>The United States operates under a dual system of securities regulation. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At the state level, individual state securities administrators enforce their own blue sky laws based on the USA.</p>

          <p>The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) was a landmark piece of legislation that clarified the boundary between federal and state jurisdiction. NSMIA established the concept of "federal covered securities" and "federal covered advisers," limiting the states' ability to regulate certain securities and persons that are already subject to federal oversight. This act was designed to reduce duplicative regulation and create a more efficient regulatory system.</p>

          <p>Despite NSMIA, states retain significant regulatory authority. They continue to regulate securities that are not federal covered, maintain anti-fraud jurisdiction over all securities (even federal covered ones), require notice filings for certain federal covered securities, and register broker-dealers, agents, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives who conduct business within their borders.</p>

            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>A critical concept for the Series 63: even though states cannot require registration of federal covered securities, they <strong>always retain anti-fraud authority</strong> over ALL securities transactions within their borders. If someone commits fraud involving a federal covered security, the state can still take action. Remember: <strong>"States always have anti-fraud jurisdiction."</strong></p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: Key Definitions Under the USA ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="key-definitions">
          <h2>Key Definitions Under the USA</h2>

          <p>The Series 63 exam places heavy emphasis on the precise definitions contained in the Uniform Securities Act. Understanding these definitions is critical because they determine who must register, what must be registered, and when certain exemptions apply. Many exam questions hinge on knowing exactly what constitutes a "security," who qualifies as a "person," or what activities make someone an "agent."</p>

          <h3>Security</h3>

          <p>The USA defines a <strong>"security"</strong> very broadly. It includes any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, certificate of interest or participation in an oil, gas, or mining title or lease or in payments out of production under such a title or lease, or any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the foregoing.</p>

          <p>The definition also includes any of the following when offered as an investment: a variable or equity interest in a variable annuity, a variable or equity interest in a variable life insurance contract, a commodity investment contract, and any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.</p>

          <p>Notably, the definition of security under the USA does <strong>NOT</strong> include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Insurance or endowment policies (fixed annuities, fixed life insurance)</li>
            <li>Interests in contributory or non-contributory pension or welfare plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</li>
            <li>Commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</li>
            <li>Collectibles (wine, coins, stamps, art) unless marketed as investment contracts</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout callout--warning">
            <div class="callout__header">
              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M10.29 3.86L1.82 18a2 2 0 0 0 1.71 3h16.94a2 2 0 0 0 1.71-3L13.71 3.86a2 2 0 0 0-3.42 0z"/><line x1="12" y1="9" x2="12" y2="13"/><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12.01" y2="17"/></svg></div>
              <p class="callout__title">Warning</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>Do not confuse <strong>variable annuities</strong> with <strong>fixed annuities</strong>. Variable annuities ARE securities because their value fluctuates based on the performance of underlying investment subaccounts. Fixed annuities are NOT securities because they guarantee a fixed rate of return and are regulated as insurance products. The exam will test this distinction frequently.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Person</h3>

          <p>Under the USA, a <strong>"person"</strong> is defined very broadly. It includes an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, a trust (where the interests of the beneficiaries are evidenced by a security), an unincorporated organization, a government, or a political subdivision of a government. This broad definition is important because it determines who can be subject to the USA's registration requirements, prohibitions, and enforcement actions.</p>

          <h3>Sale and Offer to Sell</h3>

          <p>The terms <strong>"sale"</strong> and <strong>"sell"</strong> include every contract of sale, disposition of, or attempt to dispose of a security or interest in a security for value. This includes any security given or delivered with, or as a bonus on account of, a purchase of securities or any other thing. Any exchange of securities is also considered a sale.</p>

          <p>An <strong>"offer"</strong> or <strong>"offer to sell"</strong> includes every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security for value. This is also interpreted broadly. The mere circulation of an advertisement or sales literature about a security constitutes an offer.</p>

          <p>However, certain activities do NOT constitute a sale or offer under the USA:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A bona fide pledge or loan of securities</li>
            <li>Stock dividends (if nothing of value is given by stockholders)</li>
            <li>A stock split or reverse stock split</li>
            <li>An act incident to a judicially approved reorganization (e.g., bankruptcy)</li>
            <li>Securities issued under an employee stock purchase plan that is not contributory and in which the employer receives no investment discretion</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Broker-Dealer</h3>

          <p>A <strong>"broker-dealer"</strong> is any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others (acting as a broker/agent) or for its own account (acting as a dealer/principal). This definition encompasses firms that buy and sell securities, whether for clients or for their own inventory.</p>

          <p>The following are <strong>excluded</strong> from the definition of broker-dealer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agents:</strong> Individual representatives of broker-dealers are not themselves broker-dealers</li>
            <li><strong>Issuers:</strong> Companies selling their own securities are generally not broker-dealers (with limited exceptions)</li>
            <li><strong>Banks, savings institutions, and trust companies:</strong> These are excluded so long as they are not acting beyond the scope of their banking business</li>
            <li><strong>Persons with no place of business in the state</strong> who deal exclusively with existing clients who are temporarily in the state, or who deal only with other broker-dealers or institutional buyers</li>
          </ul>

              <p class="callout__title">Example</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>ABC Securities is a firm registered in State X that buys and sells stocks for its clients. ABC is a broker-dealer. Sarah works at ABC and takes client orders. Sarah is an agent of a broker-dealer. XYZ Corporation is a technology company that issues stock through an IPO. XYZ is an issuer, not a broker-dealer. First National Bank holds securities in trust for customers. The bank is excluded from the broker-dealer definition.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Agent</h3>

          <p>An <strong>"agent"</strong> is any individual (other than a broker-dealer) who represents a broker-dealer or an issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities. Think of agents as the individual salespeople or registered representatives who work for broker-dealer firms or, in some cases, issuers.</p>

          <p>Important exclusions from the agent definition include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An individual who represents an issuer in effecting transactions in <strong>exempt securities</strong> (such as government bonds or bank securities)</li>
            <li>An individual who represents an issuer in <strong>exempt transactions</strong> (discussed in Chapter 2)</li>
            <li>An individual who represents an issuer in transactions with existing employees, partners, or directors of the issuer, provided no commission is paid for soliciting any person in the state</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The distinction between who is and who is not an agent is critical for registration purposes. Agents must register in each state where they conduct business, subject to certain exemptions.</p>

          <h3>Investment Adviser</h3>

          <p>An <strong>"investment adviser"</strong> is any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others (either directly or through publications or writings) about the value of securities or the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities. This also includes any person who, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.</p>

          <p>The three-pronged test for determining if someone is an investment adviser is often called the <strong>"ABC test"</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>A</strong> - Advice: The person provides advice or analyses about securities</li>
            <li><strong>B</strong> - Business: The person is in the business of providing such advice (it is a regular activity, not a one-time occurrence)</li>
            <li><strong>C</strong> - Compensation: The person receives compensation for the advice (the compensation does not need to be a separate advisory fee; it can be any economic benefit)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>All three elements must be present for a person to be classified as an investment adviser under the USA.</p>

              <p>Remember the <strong>ABC test</strong> for investment advisers: <strong>A</strong>dvice about securities + <strong>B</strong>usiness (regular activity) + <strong>C</strong>ompensation received = Investment Adviser. If any one element is missing, the person is NOT an investment adviser under the USA. For example, a friend who gives free stock tips at a dinner party fails the "C" (compensation) prong and is not an IA.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Investment Adviser Representative (IAR)</h3>

          <p>An <strong>"investment adviser representative"</strong> (IAR) is any individual employed by or associated with an investment adviser or federal covered adviser who makes recommendations or otherwise renders investment advice regarding securities, manages accounts or portfolios of clients, determines which recommendation or advice regarding securities should be given, solicits, offers, or negotiates for the sale of or sells investment advisory services, or supervises employees who perform any of these functions.</p>

          <p>IARs are the individuals who actually interact with clients on behalf of the investment advisory firm. Just as agents must register with the state, IARs must also register in the states where they conduct advisory business. This is true even if the investment advisory firm itself is a "federal covered adviser" registered with the SEC rather than with the state.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: Federal Covered Securities ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="federal-covered-securities">
          <h2>Federal Covered Securities</h2>

          <p>The concept of "federal covered securities" is central to understanding the boundary between state and federal jurisdiction. Under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA), certain securities are deemed to be primarily regulated at the federal level, and states are preempted from requiring their registration. However, states retain their anti-fraud authority and may require a "notice filing" (essentially a copy of the federal registration along with a filing fee).</p>

          <h3>What Qualifies as a Federal Covered Security?</h3>

          <p>The following securities are classified as federal covered:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Securities listed on national exchanges:</strong> Any security listed, or authorized for listing, on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or other nationally recognized exchanges (known as "covered securities under Section 18(b)(1)" of the Securities Act of 1933).

          <h3>Notice Filing Requirements</h3>

          <p>Although states cannot require registration of federal covered securities, they can require a <strong>notice filing</strong>. This is essentially a notification to the state that a federal covered security is being sold within its borders. The notice filing typically consists of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A copy of the documents filed with the SEC (e.g., the federal registration statement or Form D)</li>
            <li>A consent to service of process (allowing the state to serve legal papers on the issuer)</li>
            <li>A filing fee as specified by state law</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Notice filings are most commonly required for investment company securities (mutual funds) and Rule 506 private placements. The state Administrator can revoke the effectiveness of a notice filing if it was incomplete or fraudulent, but the Administrator cannot impose additional registration requirements beyond what is required federally.</p>

              <p>Federal covered securities = primarily regulated by the SEC. States can require notice filing and fees but CANNOT require full state registration. States ALWAYS retain anti-fraud authority. Non-covered securities must go through full state registration (by coordination, notification, or qualification).</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: Jurisdiction Over Persons ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="jurisdiction-over-persons">
          <h2>Jurisdiction Over Persons and Securities</h2>

          <p>Understanding when a state has jurisdiction (legal authority) over a person or a securities transaction is essential for the Series 63. Jurisdiction determines whether the state can require registration, investigate activities, and take enforcement action.</p>

          <h3>When Does a State Have Jurisdiction?</h3>

          <p>A state generally has jurisdiction over a securities transaction if the <strong>offer to sell or the offer to buy</strong> is made within the state, or if the <strong>offer is accepted</strong> within the state. This is a broad standard that can encompass many situations. Under the USA:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>An <strong>offer to sell</strong> is made in the state where the offer <strong>originates</strong> (i.e., where the seller is located when making the offer).</li>
            <li>An <strong>offer to sell</strong> is also made in the state where the offer is <strong>directed</strong> (i.e., where the potential buyer is located when receiving the offer).</li>
            <li>An <strong>offer to buy</strong> is made in the state where the buyer is located when making the offer, AND in the state where the offer is directed to and received by the seller.</li>
            <li>A <strong>sale</strong> takes place in the state where the offer to sell is accepted, AND in the state where the offer to buy is accepted.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This means that multiple states can have jurisdiction over a single transaction. For example, if a broker-dealer agent in State A calls a client in State B to offer a security, both State A (where the offer originates) and State B (where the offer is directed and received) have jurisdiction over that offer.</p>

          <h3>Publication and Broadcast Exception</h3>

          <p>The USA includes an important exception for offers made through publications and broadcasts. An offer is NOT considered to be made in the state if the publisher or broadcaster has no office in the state, the publication or broadcast is not primarily intended for residents of the state, and the communication is bona fide (not designed to circumvent the law).</p>

          <p>For example, if a nationally distributed financial newspaper includes an advertisement for a security offering, that advertisement is not considered an offer made in every state where the newspaper is delivered, provided the newspaper is not specifically targeted to that state's residents.</p>

          <div class="callout callout--example">
            <div class="callout__header">
              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><rect x="2" y="3" width="20" height="14" rx="2"/><line x1="8" y1="21" x2="16" y2="21"/><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12" y2="21"/></svg></div>
              <p class="callout__title">Example</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>Agent Maria in New York calls investor Tom in New Jersey to recommend purchasing shares of a non-listed company. This offer to sell is made in both New York (where the offer originates) and New Jersey (where the offer is directed and received). Both states have jurisdiction over this transaction. If Tom accepts the offer while in New Jersey, the sale takes place in New Jersey (where the offer to sell was accepted). Maria must be registered in both states, and the security must be registered in (or exempt from registration in) both states.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>The Administrator's Jurisdiction Over Persons</h3>

          <p>The state securities Administrator has jurisdiction over any person who:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Sells or offers to sell securities within the state</li>
            <li>Buys or offers to buy securities within the state</li>
            <li>Provides investment advice from within the state</li>
            <li>Conducts any activity that constitutes a violation of the USA within the state's borders</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Importantly, the Administrator also has jurisdiction over persons who have no physical presence in the state if their conduct is directed into the state. A broker-dealer in California that makes cold calls to residents of Florida is subject to Florida's jurisdiction, even though the firm has no office in Florida.</p>

          <h3>Consent to Service of Process</h3>

          <p>Every person who registers with a state (or who files a notice filing) must file a <strong>consent to service of process</strong>. This is a legal document that appoints the state Administrator (or a designee) as the person's attorney-in-fact for purposes of receiving legal papers (such as lawsuits or administrative orders). This ensures that the state can serve process on any registered person, even if they are located out of state.</p>

          <p>The consent to service of process has the same force and effect as if the person had been personally served within the state. It remains in effect even after the person's registration has expired or been withdrawn, so the state can still bring actions related to conduct that occurred while the person was registered.</p>

            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The rise of the internet has created complex jurisdictional questions. If a broker-dealer in Texas posts an offering on its website, does that constitute an offer to sell in all 50 states? NASAA and state regulators have generally adopted the position that a website accessible to all states constitutes an offer in each state where a resident can access it, unless the website contains prominent disclaimers limiting the offering to certain states or the firm takes reasonable steps to verify that purchasers are located in permitted states.</p>

              <p>Many firms address this by including disclaimers on their websites (e.g., "Securities offered only to residents of states where the firm is registered"), using geolocation tools, or requiring potential investors to confirm their state of residence before accessing offering materials. However, mere disclaimers may not be sufficient if a firm actively solicits business in a state where it is not registered.</p>

              <p>The key principle remains: if the offer reaches a person in the state, the state may assert jurisdiction. This is why proper registration and compliance are essential for firms conducting business online.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 5: The Administrator ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="the-administrator">
          <h2>The State Securities Administrator</h2>

          <p>Each state designates an official (or office) to administer and enforce its securities laws. Under the USA, this official is referred to as the <strong>"Administrator."</strong> The actual title varies by state: it may be the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Commissioner of Securities, Director of the Division of Securities, or another designated official. Regardless of title, the Administrator's powers and responsibilities are defined by the state's securities statute.</p>

          <h3>Powers of the Administrator</h3>

          <p>The Administrator has broad powers to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the securities markets within the state. These powers include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking:</strong> The Administrator may make, amend, and rescind rules and forms necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. These rules have the force of law.</li>
            <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> The Administrator may conduct investigations within or outside the state as deemed necessary to determine whether a violation has occurred or is about to occur.</li>
            <li><strong>Subpoena power:</strong> The Administrator may issue subpoenas to compel the production of documents and the testimony of witnesses in connection with investigations.</li>
            <li><strong>Issuing orders:</strong> The Administrator may issue cease and desist orders, deny, suspend, revoke, or cancel registrations, and impose conditions on registrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooperating with other regulators:</strong> The Administrator may cooperate with other state, federal, and international regulators to share information and coordinate enforcement efforts.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Limitations on the Administrator</h3>

          <p>Despite these broad powers, the Administrator is subject to important limitations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Administrator <strong>cannot impose criminal penalties</strong> (imprisonment or criminal fines). Only a court of law can impose criminal sanctions. The Administrator must refer criminal matters to the appropriate prosecuting authority.</li>
            <li>The Administrator <strong>cannot issue injunctions</strong>. Only a court can issue an injunction. The Administrator can, however, petition a court to grant an injunction.</li>
            <li>The Administrator <strong>cannot require the registration of federal covered securities</strong> (per NSMIA), but can require notice filings.</li>
            <li>The Administrator's actions are subject to <strong>judicial review</strong>. Any person adversely affected by an Administrator's order has the right to appeal to a court.</li>
          </ul>

              <p>The exam frequently asks what the Administrator <strong>CANNOT</strong> do. Remember these three: (1) The Administrator cannot impose jail time or criminal fines. (2) The Administrator cannot issue injunctions. (3) The Administrator cannot require registration of federal covered securities.

              Historical Context of Blue Sky Laws
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The history of state securities regulation dates back to 1911, when Kansas became the first state to enact a securities law. The law was championed by J.N. Dolley, the Kansas banking commissioner, who was concerned about the number of fraudulent investment schemes targeting Kansas farmers. Dolley described the promoters as selling "building lots in the blue sky," hence the term "blue sky laws."</p>

              <p>Other states quickly followed Kansas's lead. By 1933, when the federal Securities Act was enacted, every state except Nevada had some form of securities regulation. The state laws varied considerably, which created challenges for companies seeking to raise capital across state lines. This inconsistency was one of the motivations behind the creation of the Uniform Securities Act in 1956.</p>

              <p>The USA went through several revisions. The 1956 version established the basic framework. The 1985 revision added provisions for investment advisers and updated the Act to reflect changes in the securities industry. The 2002 revision, the most recent, incorporated changes necessitated by NSMIA and the growth of electronic commerce in securities.</p>

              <p>Today, the Series 63 exam is based on the principles of the USA as interpreted by NASAA model rules and statements of policy. While individual states may vary in their specific implementation, the exam tests the uniform principles that apply broadly across jurisdictions.</p>

            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">1. Under the Uniform Securities Act, which of the following is NOT included in the definition of a "security"?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) Variable annuity contract</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) Investment contract</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">C) Fixed annuity issued by an insurance company</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Preorganization certificate</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              A fixed annuity is an insurance product that guarantees a fixed rate of return and is NOT a security under the USA. Variable annuities, investment contracts, and preorganization certificates are all included in the broad definition of a security.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">2. The state securities Administrator has the power to do all of the following EXCEPT:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) Issue subpoenas for documents</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) Issue cease and desist orders</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">C) Impose criminal penalties including imprisonment</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Deny or revoke registrations</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              The Administrator cannot impose criminal penalties such as imprisonment or criminal fines. Only a court of law can impose criminal sanctions. The Administrator can issue subpoenas, cease and desist orders, and deny or revoke registrations.

          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">3. Which of the following is a "federal covered security" under NSMIA?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) A security sold only to residents of one state</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) A stock listed on the NYSE</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) A non-exchange-listed OTC security</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) A promissory note with a 90-day maturity</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Securities listed on national exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq are federal covered securities under NSMIA. States cannot require their registration but may require a notice filing. Intrastate offerings and non-listed OTC securities are not federal covered.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">4. To be classified as an investment adviser under the USA, all of the following must be present EXCEPT:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) The person provides advice about securities</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) The person has passed the Series 65 examination</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) The person is in the business of providing such advice</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) The person receives compensation for the advice</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              The "ABC test" for investment advisers requires Advice about securities, Business (regular activity), and Compensation. Passing the Series 65 is a registration requirement, not part of the statutory definition. A person can meet the definition of an IA without having passed any exam.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">5. An agent in State X calls a prospect in State Y to offer securities. Which state(s) have jurisdiction over this offer?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) Only State X</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) Only State Y</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">C) Both State X and State Y</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Neither state until a sale is completed</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Both states have jurisdiction. State X has jurisdiction because the offer originated there (where the agent is located). State Y has jurisdiction because the offer was directed to and received by the prospect there. Jurisdiction attaches at the offer stage, not only at the sale stage.
