        <!-- ====== SECTION 1: Securities Legislation ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="securities-legislation">
          <h2>Securities Legislation</h2>

          <p>The modern U.S. securities regulatory framework was built primarily in response to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. Before these landmark laws, securities markets operated with little oversight, rampant fraud, and minimal investor protections. Understanding the major securities laws, their purposes, and their key provisions is essential for the SIE exam, which dedicates approximately 9% of its questions to regulatory topics.</p>

          <h3>Securities Act of 1933 (The Paper Act)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Securities Act of 1933</strong> was the first major federal securities law, enacted in response to the widespread fraud and lack of transparency that contributed to the 1929 market crash. Its two primary objectives are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Require that investors receive significant financial and other information about securities being offered for public sale (through a registration statement and prospectus).</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Fraud:</strong> Prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The 1933 Act is often called the <strong>"Paper Act"</strong> or the <strong>"Truth in Securities Act"</strong> because it focuses on the initial issuance and sale of new securities (the primary market). It requires issuers to file a <strong>registration statement</strong> with the SEC before offering securities to the public. The registration statement includes detailed information about the company's business, financial condition, management, and the securities being offered. The prospectus, which is part of the registration statement, must be delivered to investors before or at the time of sale.</p>

          <p>Key concepts under the 1933 Act include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration Statement:</strong> Filed with the SEC on Form S-1 (for IPOs) or other applicable forms. The SEC reviews the filing for completeness and adequacy of disclosure but does NOT approve or disapprove the investment merit of the securities.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling-Off Period:</strong> The minimum 20-day period between the filing date and the effective date. During this period, the preliminary prospectus (red herring) may be distributed, but no sales can be made and no final offering price can be stated.</li>
            <li><strong>Prospectus:</strong> The key document containing all material information about the offering. The final prospectus must be delivered to all purchasers.</li>
            <li><strong>Exempt Securities:</strong> Certain securities are exempt from registration, including U.S. government securities, municipal bonds, commercial paper (maturity of 270 days or less), and securities of banks and savings institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Exempt Transactions:</strong> Certain transactions are exempt from registration, including private placements (Regulation D), intrastate offerings (Rule 147), and small offerings (Regulation A/A+).</li>
          </ul>

              <p>The SEC does <strong>NOT</strong> approve or disapprove securities. It reviews registration statements for adequate disclosure. Any statement suggesting SEC approval is a violation. Remember: the 1933 Act regulates the <strong>primary market</strong> (new issues); the 1934 Act regulates the <strong>secondary market</strong> (trading).</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (The People Act)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Securities Exchange Act of 1934</strong> established the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> and governs the secondary trading of securities. While the 1933 Act focuses on new issues, the 1934 Act regulates the ongoing trading of securities after they have been issued. It is often called the <strong>"People Act"</strong> because it regulates the people and entities involved in securities trading.</p>

          <p>Key provisions of the 1934 Act include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creation of the SEC:</strong> Established the SEC as the primary federal regulator of the securities markets, with authority to oversee exchanges, broker-dealers, and self-regulatory organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Registration of Exchanges and Broker-Dealers:</strong> Requires all national securities exchanges and broker-dealers to register with the SEC.</li>
            <li><strong>Periodic Reporting:</strong> Requires publicly traded companies to file periodic reports (10-K annual, 10-Q quarterly, 8-K current events) to provide ongoing disclosure to investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy Solicitation:</strong> Regulates the process by which companies solicit shareholder votes.</li>
            <li><strong>Insider Trading (Section 10b / Rule 10b-5):</strong> Prohibits fraud and manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, including insider trading.</li>
            <li><strong>Tender Offers:</strong> Regulates the process of one company making a public offer to buy shares of another company.</li>
            <li><strong>Short Sales:</strong> Grants the SEC authority to regulate short selling.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Regulation:</strong> Grants the Federal Reserve Board authority to regulate the extension of credit for purchasing securities (Regulation T for broker-dealers, Regulation U for banks).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Investment Company Act of 1940</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Investment Company Act of 1940</strong> regulates the organization and activities of companies that invest in securities and offer their own securities to the public. This act is primarily concerned with <strong>mutual funds</strong>, <strong>closed-end funds</strong>, and <strong>unit investment trusts (UITs)</strong>. Key provisions include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Investment companies must register with the SEC</li>
            <li>At least <strong>40% of the board of directors</strong> must be independent (non-interested persons), and a majority of 75% is recommended</li>
            <li>Investment company shares must be sold at the current <strong>net asset value (NAV)</strong> plus any applicable sales charge</li>
            <li>Changes to the fund's investment objectives require <strong>shareholder approval</strong></li>
            <li>Restrictions on leverage, affiliated transactions, and custodial arrangements</li>
            <li>Annual and semi-annual reports must be provided to shareholders</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Investment Advisers Act of 1940</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Investment Advisers Act of 1940</strong> regulates investment advisers -- persons or firms that, for compensation, engage in the business of advising others about securities. The act requires most investment advisers with $100 million or more in assets under management (AUM) to register with the SEC; smaller advisers generally register with state regulators. Key concepts include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Investment advisers owe a <strong>fiduciary duty</strong> to their clients (the highest standard of care)</li>
            <li>Advisers must disclose all material conflicts of interest</li>
            <li>Brochure delivery requirement (Form ADV Part 2) to new clients and annually thereafter</li>
            <li>Performance-based compensation is generally prohibited for retail clients</li>
            <li>Custody and recordkeeping requirements</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act (2010)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</strong> was enacted in 2010 in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It is the most comprehensive financial reform legislation since the 1930s. Key provisions relevant to the SIE exam include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Created the <strong>Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)</strong> to monitor systemic risk</li>
            <li>Established the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</strong> to protect consumers in financial transactions</li>
            <li>Implemented the <strong>Volcker Rule</strong>, which restricts banks from proprietary trading and limits their investments in hedge funds and private equity</li>
            <li>Enhanced regulation of <strong>over-the-counter derivatives</strong> (swaps and security-based swaps)</li>
            <li>Strengthened <strong>whistleblower protections</strong> and created financial incentives for reporting securities violations to the SEC</li>
            <li>Explicitly prohibited <strong>spoofing</strong> in commodity and securities markets</li>
            <li>Raised the accredited investor threshold by excluding primary residence equity from the net worth calculation</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>JOBS Act (2012)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act</strong> of 2012 was designed to make it easier for small companies to raise capital. Key provisions include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Created the <strong>Emerging Growth Company (EGC)</strong> category with reduced reporting requirements for companies with less than $1.07 billion in annual revenue during IPO</li>
            <li>Expanded <strong>Regulation A+</strong> (Tier 1 up to $20 million, Tier 2 up to $75 million) as a streamlined alternative to full SEC registration</li>
            <li>Legalized <strong>equity crowdfunding</strong> (Regulation Crowdfunding), allowing companies to raise up to $5 million from the general public through SEC-registered platforms</li>
            <li>Lifted the ban on <strong>general solicitation</strong> for certain private placements under Rule 506(c) (if all purchasers are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify their status)</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 2: SRO Structure ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="sro-structure">
          <h2>Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) Structure</h2>

          <p>The U.S. securities regulatory system operates on a two-tiered model: the SEC serves as the ultimate federal regulator, while <strong>Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)</strong> handle the day-to-day regulation of their members. SROs are authorized by the SEC to create and enforce rules governing the conduct of their members. This structure allows for more efficient and industry-specific regulation while maintaining federal oversight.</p>

          <h3>FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)</h3>

          <p><strong>FINRA</strong> is the largest SRO for the securities industry. It was formed in 2007 through the merger of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA's responsibilities include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Member Regulation:</strong> Overseeing approximately 3,400 brokerage firms and more than 624,000 registered securities representatives</li>
            <li><strong>Qualification Exams:</strong> Administering licensing exams, including the SIE, Series 6, Series 7, Series 63, Series 65, and Series 66</li>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking:</strong> Creating and enforcing rules governing member firm conduct, sales practices, and market integrity</li>
            <li><strong>Examination and Enforcement:</strong> Conducting regular examinations of member firms and pursuing disciplinary actions for rule violations</li>
            <li><strong>Market Surveillance:</strong> Monitoring trading activity across U.S. securities markets to detect manipulation, insider trading, and other violations</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> Operating the largest securities dispute resolution forum (arbitration and mediation) for resolving disputes between investors and firms</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All broker-dealer firms that conduct securities business with the public must be members of FINRA. FINRA membership is a prerequisite for operating as a broker-dealer in the United States (with narrow exceptions for firms that conduct only government securities or institutional business).</p>

          <h3>MSRB (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>MSRB</strong> writes rules governing the municipal securities market, including rules for municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors. Unlike FINRA, the MSRB does <strong>not</strong> have enforcement authority. Instead, FINRA enforces MSRB rules for broker-dealers, the SEC enforces them for non-bank dealers, and federal banking regulators enforce them for bank dealers. The MSRB also operates the <strong>EMMA (Electronic Municipal Market Access)</strong> system, which provides free public access to municipal securities disclosures and trade data.</p>

          <h3>NYSE and Other Exchanges</h3>

          <p>The <strong>New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</strong>, <strong>Nasdaq</strong>, <strong>CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange)</strong>, and other national securities exchanges are also SROs. Each exchange has its own listing standards, trading rules, and disciplinary procedures. Exchanges must register with the SEC and have their proposed rules approved by the SEC before implementation. The CBOE is the primary exchange for listed options trading and sets rules for options market participants.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 3: Registration Requirements ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="registration-requirements">
          <h2>Registration Requirements</h2>

          <p>Any individual who wants to work in the securities industry as a registered representative must meet specific registration requirements. This involves passing qualifying examinations, filing registration forms, and maintaining ongoing education requirements. The SIE exam frequently tests your knowledge of these processes.</p>

          <h3>Form U4 and Form U5</h3>

          <p><strong>Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer)</strong> is the registration form used to apply for registration with FINRA and with the states. The form collects detailed personal information, employment history, disciplinary history, criminal history, financial information (including bankruptcies and judgments), and other disclosure items. Key facts about Form U4:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Filed by the <strong>sponsoring firm</strong>, not by the individual (an individual cannot self-register; they must be sponsored by a FINRA member firm)</li>
            <li>Must be filed within <strong>30 days</strong> of the individual's association with the firm</li>
            <li>All information must be kept <strong>current</strong>; updates are required within 30 days for most changes (and within 10 days for certain customer complaints, regulatory actions, and criminal matters)</li>
            <li>Contains <strong>disclosure questions</strong> (DQ) covering criminal history, regulatory actions, civil judicial actions, customer complaints, terminations, and financial disclosures (bankruptcies, liens, judgments)</li>
            <li>The form is available to the public through FINRA's <strong>BrokerCheck</strong> system (with some personal information redacted)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Form U5 (Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration)</strong> is filed when a registered person leaves a member firm. The firm must file Form U5 within <strong>30 days</strong> of the termination date. The U5 includes the reason for termination and any updated disclosure information. If an individual disagrees with the information on their U5, they may file a comment through the CRD system but cannot prevent the firm from filing it.</p>

          <div class="callout callout--exam-tip">

              <div class="callout__icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M12 2L2 7l10 5 10-5-10-5z"/><path d="M2 17l10 5 10-5"/><path d="M2 12l10 5 10-5"/></svg></div>

            </div>
            <div class="callout__content">
              <p>A registered person cannot be their own sponsor. Registration always requires a <strong>sponsoring firm</strong>. However, the SIE exam itself does <strong>not</strong> require firm sponsorship -- it can be taken by anyone age 18 or older. Representative-level exams (Series 6, 7, etc.) DO require firm sponsorship.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Statutory Disqualification</h3>

          <p><strong>Statutory disqualification</strong> is a condition that prevents an individual or firm from associating with a FINRA member firm. Grounds for statutory disqualification include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Conviction of certain <strong>felonies</strong> within the past 10 years (any felony or certain securities-related misdemeanors)</li>
            <li>Expulsion or suspension from a <strong>self-regulatory organization</strong></li>
            <li>Being subject to an SEC order denying, suspending, or revoking registration</li>
            <li>Filing a <strong>false or misleading</strong> application or report with a regulatory body</li>
            <li>Being subject to a court injunction involving securities-related activities</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A statutorily disqualified person is not automatically barred from the industry permanently. FINRA has a process by which a member firm may apply for relief, allowing the disqualified person to associate with the firm under heightened supervision. This requires FINRA's explicit approval.</p>

          <h3>Continuing Education</h3>

          <p>FINRA requires all registered persons to participate in a <strong>continuing education (CE)</strong> program that has two components:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Element:</strong> Required on the <strong>second anniversary</strong> of initial registration and every <strong>three years</strong> thereafter. Content is determined by FINRA and covers regulatory, compliance, ethical, and sales practice standards. If a registered person fails to complete the Regulatory Element by the required date, their registration becomes <strong>inactive</strong> until it is completed. They cannot engage in any activities requiring registration while inactive. As of 2023, FINRA transitioned the Regulatory Element to an annual format delivered through an online learning platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Firm Element:</strong> Developed and administered by each member firm annually. The content is tailored to the firm's business, products, and the needs of its registered persons. Firms must maintain a written training plan and deliver the training at least annually. The Firm Element covers products, services, and regulatory developments relevant to the firm's business.</li>
          </ul>

            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>The registration process for a new associated person follows these steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Firm Sponsorship:</strong> The individual receives a conditional offer of employment from a FINRA member firm. The firm agrees to sponsor the individual's registration.</li>
                <li><strong>Fingerprinting:</strong> The individual is fingerprinted as required by the Exchange Act. Fingerprints are submitted to the FBI for a criminal background check.</li>
                <li><strong>Form U4 Filing:</strong> The firm files Form U4 through the Web CRD (Central Registration Depository) system, maintained by FINRA. The individual must truthfully answer all disclosure questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualification Exams:</strong> The individual must pass the required qualification exams. The SIE is the prerequisite; a top-off exam (e.g., Series 7 for general securities, Series 6 for investment company/variable products) is also required for most registration categories.</li>
                <li><strong>State Registration:</strong> The firm files the individual's registration with applicable state securities regulators through the CRD system. Many states require passage of a state law exam (Series 63, 65, or 66).</li>
                <li><strong>Approval:</strong> FINRA and the applicable states review the filing and either approve the registration or request additional information. Upon approval, the individual is a registered representative authorized to conduct securities business.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The CRD system is the centralized database that FINRA uses to maintain the registration records of all broker-dealer firms and their associated persons. The public-facing version of this database is <strong>BrokerCheck</strong>, which allows investors to research the background and qualifications of financial professionals.</p>

        <!-- ====== SECTION 4: Communications Rules ====== -->
        <section class="lesson__section" id="communications-rules">
          <h2>Communications Rules</h2>

          <p>FINRA Rule 2210 governs communications with the public by member firms. All communications must be fair, balanced, and not misleading. The rule categorizes communications into three types, each with different pre-approval and filing requirements.</p>

          <h3>Categories of Communications</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Retail Communication:</strong> Any written (including electronic) communication that is distributed or made available to more than <strong>25 retail investors</strong> within any 30-calendar-day period. Examples include advertisements, websites, social media posts visible to the public, sales literature, and mass emails to retail clients. Retail communications are subject to the most rigorous oversight requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Communication:</strong> Any written communication distributed or made available <strong>only to institutional investors</strong> (such as banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, and entities with $50 million+ in assets). Institutional communications do not require pre-approval by a principal but must be subject to the firm's supervisory procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> Any written communication distributed to <strong>25 or fewer retail investors</strong> within any 30-calendar-day period. This includes individual emails, letters, and direct messages. Like institutional communications, correspondence does not require pre-approval by a principal but must be supervised.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Filing Requirements</h3>

          <p>Certain retail communications must be filed with FINRA's Advertising Regulation Department:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>During the firm's <strong>first year of FINRA membership</strong>, all retail communications must be filed with FINRA at least <strong>10 business days before first use</strong> (pre-use filing)</li>
            <li>After the first year, most retail communications must be filed within <strong>10 business days of first use</strong> (post-use filing)</li>
            <li>Communications about <strong>investment companies</strong> (mutual funds), <strong>options</strong>, and <strong>public direct participation programs (DPPs)</strong> must always be filed within 10 business days of first use, regardless of firm tenure</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Social Media</h3>

          <p>FINRA applies the same communications standards to social media as to other forms of communication. Whether a social media post is classified as retail communication, institutional communication, or correspondence depends on the audience. A post visible to the general public is a retail communication. FINRA distinguishes between <strong>static content</strong> (such as a firm's profile page, which functions like an advertisement) and <strong>interactive content</strong> (such as real-time conversations in chat rooms or social media comments, which are more like correspondence).</p>

          <p>Key social media rules include: firms must have written supervisory procedures for social media use; registered representatives must not make exaggerated, misleading, or promissory claims on social media; and firms must retain records of business-related social media communications in compliance with FINRA's recordkeeping requirements.</p>

          <h3>Testimonials and Endorsements</h3>

          <p>Under the SEC's Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1, effective November 2022 for investment advisers) and FINRA guidance, the use of testimonials and endorsements in communications is now permitted with appropriate disclosures and compliance procedures. Previously, testimonials were broadly prohibited. Under current rules, firms using testimonials must disclose whether the person providing the testimonial is a client, whether they received compensation, and include material facts about the relationship. Performance advertising must follow specific requirements, including showing net-of-fee returns and relevant time periods.</p>

          <h2>Customer Protection</h2>

          <p>The regulatory framework includes several important protections for investors. The SIE exam frequently tests your knowledge of SIPC coverage, margin regulations, and the customer complaint process.</p>

          <h3>SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation)</h3>

          <p>The <strong>Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)</strong> was established under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. SIPC is a nonprofit membership corporation funded by member broker-dealer assessments. Its sole purpose is to protect customers of <strong>failed broker-dealer firms</strong> by returning missing securities and cash to customers. SIPC is NOT a government agency and is NOT the same as the FDIC.</p>

              <p>SIPC coverage limits: <strong>$500,000 per customer</strong>, of which up to <strong>$250,000 may be in cash</strong>. SIPC does NOT protect against market losses, bad investment decisions, or fraud by the issuer. It ONLY protects against the <strong>failure of a broker-dealer firm</strong> (when customer securities or cash are missing from accounts).</p>

          <p>Important details about SIPC coverage:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Coverage is <strong>per customer</strong>, not per account. However, accounts held in different capacities (individual, joint, IRA, trust) may qualify as separate customers</li>
            <li>SIPC covers stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as cash held in securities accounts</li>
            <li>SIPC does <strong>NOT</strong> cover: commodity futures contracts, fixed annuity contracts, currency, or investment contracts (such as limited partnerships) not registered with the SEC</li>
            <li>SIPC does <strong>NOT</strong> protect against market losses or declines in value</li>
            <li>SIPC does <strong>NOT</strong> protect customers of investment advisers (only broker-dealers)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Regulation T (Margin Requirements)</h3>

          <p><strong>Regulation T</strong>, issued by the Federal Reserve Board under authority granted by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, governs the extension of credit by broker-dealers to customers for the purpose of purchasing securities. Key provisions include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The current Reg T initial margin requirement is <strong>50%</strong>, meaning customers must deposit at least 50% of the purchase price of marginable securities (the broker-dealer may lend the remaining 50%)</li>
            <li>Payment for securities purchased in a cash account must be received within <strong>2 business days after settlement</strong> (settlement + 2, or effectively T+3 from the trade date under T+1 settlement)</li>
            <li>Not all securities are marginable: new issues during their initial distribution, OTC securities not on the approved list, and options contracts have special margin requirements</li>
            <li>FINRA imposes a <strong>maintenance margin</strong> minimum of 25% equity (individual firms may require higher amounts, known as "house requirements")</li>
            <li>If account equity falls below the maintenance requirement, the firm issues a <strong>margin call</strong> requiring the customer to deposit additional funds or securities</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Customer Complaints</h3>

          <p>FINRA rules require member firms to have procedures for handling customer complaints. A <strong>customer complaint</strong> is any written grievance by a customer or a person authorized to act on behalf of a customer involving the activities of the firm or its associated persons. Key requirements include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>All written customer complaints must be reported to the firm's <strong>compliance or supervisory personnel</strong></li>
            <li>Firms must report certain complaints on Form U4 (for the registered representative involved) and on Form U5 (upon termination)</li>
            <li>Customer complaints are reported on <strong>FINRA BrokerCheck</strong>, making them visible to the public</li>
            <li>Firms must maintain records of all complaints for a minimum of <strong>4 years</strong></li>
            <li>Customer disputes may be resolved through <strong>FINRA arbitration</strong> (binding for industry disputes; generally required if the customer signed a pre-dispute arbitration agreement) or <strong>FINRA mediation</strong> (voluntary, non-binding)</li>
          </ul>

              FINRA Arbitration Process
            </summary>
            <div class="deep-dive__content">
              <p>FINRA operates the largest securities dispute resolution forum in the United States. The arbitration process provides a faster, less formal alternative to litigation. Here is how it works:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Filing:</strong> The claimant (usually the customer) files a Statement of Claim with FINRA, describing the dispute and the damages sought. Filing fees are based on the amount claimed.</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> The respondent (usually the firm or registered representative) files an Answer within 45 days.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrator Selection:</strong> For claims over $100,000, a panel of three arbitrators is appointed (one from the industry, two public arbitrators). For claims of $100,000 or less, a single public arbitrator may hear the case. Parties can strike and rank potential arbitrators.</li>
                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Parties exchange relevant documents. FINRA provides discovery guides listing presumptively discoverable documents for common case types.</li>
                <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> An evidentiary hearing is conducted, similar to a trial but less formal. Rules of evidence are relaxed. Hearings can last from one day to several weeks depending on complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Award:</strong> The arbitration panel issues a written award, which is final and binding. The award may include compensatory damages, interest, costs, and attorney fees. Arbitration awards are publicly available through FINRA's website.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>For claims of $50,000 or less, simplified arbitration (paper-only) is available, where the arbitrator decides based on submitted documents without an in-person hearing.</p>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">1. Which securities act is primarily concerned with the PRIMARY market and requires companies to file a registration statement before offering securities to the public?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">A) Securities Act of 1933</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">B) Securities Exchange Act of 1934</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) Investment Company Act of 1940</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Dodd-Frank Act of 2010</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              The Securities Act of 1933 (the "Paper Act") governs the primary market and requires registration of new securities with the SEC. The 1934 Act regulates the secondary market (trading). The 1940 Act covers investment companies. Dodd-Frank addresses financial reform and systemic risk.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">2. A registered representative fails to complete the Regulatory Element of continuing education by the required date. What happens?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) The registration is automatically terminated</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) The registration becomes inactive until the requirement is completed</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">C) The representative receives a warning but may continue working</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) The representative has an additional 90-day grace period</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Failure to complete the Regulatory Element by the required date results in the person's registration becoming inactive. While inactive, they cannot perform any functions requiring registration. The registration is not terminated -- it becomes inactive and can be reactivated upon completion of the CE requirement. There is no grace period.

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              Under FINRA Rule 2210, a communication distributed to more than 25 retail investors within a 30-calendar-day period is classified as a retail communication. Since 30 exceeds the 25-person threshold, this is a retail communication subject to principal pre-approval and potential FINRA filing requirements.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">4. SIPC protects customers of broker-dealer firms for up to:</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) $250,000 total per customer</button>
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="true">B) $500,000 per customer, including up to $250,000 in cash</button>

              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">D) Unlimited coverage for all securities</button>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              SIPC coverage is $500,000 per customer, of which up to $250,000 may be in cash. Coverage is per customer, not per account, though accounts held in different capacities (individual vs. IRA) may be treated as separate customers. SIPC only protects against broker-dealer failure, not market losses.

          <div class="lesson-quiz__item">
            <p class="lesson-quiz__question">5. Which entity writes rules for the municipal securities market but does NOT have enforcement authority?</p>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__options">
              <button class="answer-btn" data-correct="false">A) FINRA</button>

            </div>
            <div class="lesson-quiz__explanation" aria-hidden="true">
              The MSRB (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board) writes rules governing the municipal securities market but does not have enforcement authority. FINRA enforces MSRB rules for broker-dealers, the SEC enforces them for non-bank dealers, and federal banking regulators enforce them for bank dealers. The MSRB is unique among SROs in this rulemaking-only capacity.
