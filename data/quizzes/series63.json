    "choices": [
      "A. The adviser is exempt from registration in State B because it has fewer than 6 clients there",
      "B. The adviser must register in State B because it has any clients in that state",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under the de minimis exemption, an investment adviser with no place of business in the state is exempt from registration if it has 5 or fewer clients in the state during the preceding 12 months. With exactly 5 non-institutional clients and presumably no office in State B, this exemption applies."

    "explanation": "The publisher exclusion applies only to bona fide newspapers, news magazines, or business/financial publications of general and regular circulation. A newsletter that provides specific securities recommendations and is not of general circulation would likely not qualify for this exclusion, meaning the publisher may need to register as an IA.
