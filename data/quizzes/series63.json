    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under the Uniform Securities Act, an issuer selling its own securities is excluded from the definition of broker-dealer, provided the issuer has no place of business in the state and deals only with other broker-dealers or institutional buyers.

    "correct": 2,

The Administrator has broad authority to require additional disclosures."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under the Uniform Securities Act, a fixed annuity issued by an insurance company is excluded from the definition of 'security' because it is considered an insurance product, not an investment. Variable annuities, however, are considered securities because their value fluctuates with investment performance. Stocks, bonds, and investment contracts are all included in the definition of a security."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "An agent's registration is effective only in the state(s) where registration has been granted. Each state has its own registration requirements.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under the USA, an agent must be registered in every state where they conduct securities business. Since the agent works in State A and solicits customers in State B, registration is required in both states.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "It is illegal to state or imply that a security has been approved or endorsed by the Administrator or any regulatory authority.
