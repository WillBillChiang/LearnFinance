      "A. As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded increases",
      "B. As the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases",
      "C. As income rises, consumers buy more inferior goods",
      "D. As supply increases, prices increase"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity demanded by consumers increases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The Federal Reserve uses three primary tools to implement monetary policy: setting the discount rate (the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed), conducting open market operations (buying and selling government securities), and setting reserve requirements. Tax rates and government spending are fiscal policy tools controlled by Congress."

    "explanation": "A flat yield curve occurs when short-term and long-term interest rates are approximately equal. This typically signals uncertainty about the future economic outlook and often occurs during transitions between economic phases. A flat yield curve may precede either an inverted curve (suggesting recession) or a return to a normal upward-sloping curve (suggesting continued growth)."

Under this theory, a long-term rate is essentially the average of expected future short-term rates. An upward-sloping yield curve would indicate that the market expects short-term rates to rise."

Separate accounts are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940."

    "choices": [
      "A. They pay interest semiannually",

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount from their face (par) value and do not make periodic interest payments. The investor's return comes from the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value received at maturity. Despite receiving no cash interest, investors must pay income tax annually on the imputed (phantom) interest, creating a potential tax disadvantage for taxable accounts."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The closed-end fund is trading at a discount because its market price ($8.50) is below its NAV ($10.00). The discount is calculated as (Market Price - NAV) / NAV = ($8.50 - $10.00) / $10.00 = -15%. Closed-end funds frequently trade at premiums or discounts to NAV because their shares trade on exchanges based on supply and demand, unlike open-end funds which always trade at NAV."

For taxable bonds, the annual amortization reduces the amount of taxable interest income. At maturity, the cost basis will equal par value, so there is no capital gain or loss upon redemption."

In this scenario, the investor should consider the yield to call rather than the yield to maturity, as the bond may not remain outstanding until maturity. The yield to call will be lower than the yield to maturity for premium bonds."

Perfect negative correlation (-1.0) would theoretically eliminate all unsystematic risk."

    "explanation": "A bond ladder strategy involves purchasing bonds with staggered (evenly spaced) maturities. For example, an investor might buy bonds maturing in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. As each bond matures, the proceeds are reinvested in a new long-term bond. This approach reduces interest rate risk, provides regular liquidity, and allows the investor to take advantage of different interest rate environments over time."

    "explanation": "Loss aversion, a key concept in behavioral finance developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, suggests that investors experience the pain of a loss approximately twice as intensely as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. This asymmetry in emotional response can lead to irrational behavior, such as holding losing investments too long (hoping to avoid realizing a loss) or selling winners too quickly (locking in gains)."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The wash sale rule disallows a capital loss deduction if the investor purchases a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale that generated the loss (creating a 61-day window). This rule prevents investors from selling securities solely to realize a tax loss and then immediately repurchasing the same security. The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement security."

    "explanation": "During the distribution phase of retirement, the primary focus should be on managing withdrawals to sustain the portfolio throughout the client's expected lifetime. This involves establishing a sustainable withdrawal rate (commonly cited as the 4% rule as a starting point), maintaining an appropriate asset allocation that balances growth and preservation, and considering factors such as inflation, required minimum distributions, and healthcare costs."

Any municipal yield above 3.4% would make the municipal bond preferable on an after-tax basis.

Without a QDOT, the unlimited marital deduction is not available because the government is concerned the non-citizen spouse could leave the country with the assets, avoiding U.S. estate tax.

    "explanation": "Under SEC rules, investment advisers may charge performance-based fees only to 'qualified clients,' defined as individuals with at least $1 million in assets under management with the adviser, or individuals with a net worth exceeding $2.1 million (excluding the primary residence). This restriction protects less sophisticated investors from fee arrangements that could incentivize excessive risk-taking by the adviser."

This ensures that the information on file with regulators and available to the public remains current. Additionally, advisers must update Form ADV promptly (typically within 30 days) whenever certain information becomes materially inaccurate, such as changes in ownership, services, or disciplinary events."

Named after Charles Ponzi, these schemes are a form of securities fraud."

If $1,200 was prepaid for 6 months ($200/month) and the client terminates after 2 months, the adviser earned $400 and must refund the remaining $800.
