    "choices": ["A. The state where the adviser's principal office is located", "B. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)", "C. Both the SEC and the state", "D. FINRA"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, investment advisers with assets under management (AUM) of $100 million or more generally must register with the SEC. Advisers with AUM between $100-$110 million are in a buffer zone and may register with either. Advisers with $110 million or more must register with the SEC."

    "choices": ["A. Guarantee investment returns", "B. Always place the client's interests ahead of their own", "C. Only invest in risk-free securities", "D. Avoid charging fees for services"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A fiduciary duty requires the investment adviser to always act in the best interest of the client, placing the client's interests ahead of their own. This includes the duty of loyalty (avoiding conflicts of interest or disclosing them) and the duty of care (providing suitable advice based on thorough analysis)."

    "choices": ["A. An agency cross transaction", "B. A principal transaction", "C. A block trade", "D. An allocation trade"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When an investment adviser buys securities from or sells securities to a client's account for the adviser's own account (or an account in which the adviser has a financial interest), it is a principal transaction. The adviser must disclose this conflict and obtain the client's consent before the completion of each such transaction."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz, focuses on portfolio construction and the relationship between risk and return at the portfolio level. MPT demonstrates that diversification can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return, and that the risk-return profile of the entire portfolio matters more than that of individual securities."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Beta measures systematic (market) risk, which is the sensitivity of a security's returns relative to the overall market. A beta of 1.0 means the security moves with the market. A beta greater than 1.0 indicates greater volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 indicates less volatility."

    "choices": ["A. Alpha", "B. Beta", "C. Sharpe ratio", "D. R-squared"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return by dividing the excess return (portfolio return minus risk-free rate) by the portfolio's standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviation measures total risk (both systematic and unsystematic)."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Banks and bank holding companies are excluded from the definition of investment adviser under both the federal Investment Advisers Act and the Uniform Securities Act.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Investment advisers must deliver the Form ADV Part 2 (firm brochure) and Part 2B (brochure supplement) to prospective clients at or before entering into an advisory contract. Additionally, advisers must offer to deliver an updated brochure annually. This ensures clients have important information about the adviser before committing."

    "choices": ["A. Allocate all shares to the largest account", "B. Allocate shares proportionally and fairly among eligible client accounts", "C. Allocate shares to the account that generates the most fees", "D. Allocate shares first to accounts of family members"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to treat all clients fairly in trade allocation. When allocating limited shares (such as IPOs), the adviser must use a fair and equitable method, typically pro-rata allocation based on account size or a rotation system. Favoring certain accounts over others is a breach of fiduciary duty."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Alpha measures the excess return of a portfolio relative to its expected return based on its beta and the market return (using the Capital Asset Pricing Model). A positive alpha of +2.5 indicates the portfolio outperformed its expected return by 2.5% on a risk-adjusted basis, suggesting skillful management."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "CAPM calculates expected return as: Risk-free rate + Beta x (Expected market return - Risk-free rate). The model uses the risk-free rate (typically Treasury bills), the security's beta (systematic risk), and the expected market return to determine the required rate of return for an investment."

    "choices": ["A. Any client who agrees to it", "B. Only clients who meet the qualified client threshold", "C. Only institutional clients", "D. Performance fees are always prohibited"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under both federal and state law, investment advisers may charge performance-based fees only to qualified clients. A qualified client is generally defined as having at least $1.1 million in assets under management with the adviser or a net worth exceeding $2.2 million. This protects less sophisticated investors from the risks associated with performance-based fee arrangements."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Investment advisers must disclose soft dollar arrangements to clients. Under the safe harbor of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, advisers may use soft dollars for eligible research products and services that help in the investment decision-making process. The adviser must seek best execution and cannot sacrifice execution quality solely to obtain soft dollar benefits."

    "choices": ["A. Extend the portfolio's duration", "B. Shorten the portfolio's duration", "C. Increase allocation to zero-coupon bonds", "D. Increase allocation to long-term bonds"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When interest rates are expected to rise, bond prices will fall. Shortening the portfolio's duration reduces the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes. Shorter-duration bonds experience smaller price declines when rates rise. Extending duration or adding zero-coupon/long-term bonds would increase rate sensitivity."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy of investing a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals regardless of market conditions. This results in purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, potentially lowering the average cost per share over time. It does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss."

    "choices": ["A. Higher bonding requirements only", "B. Annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant", "C. Weekly reporting to the SEC", "D. Dual registration as a broker-dealer"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When an investment adviser has custody of client assets, the adviser must undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify client assets. This requirement protects clients from misappropriation. The adviser must also maintain client funds with a qualified custodian and provide regular account statements."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The duty of care requires advisers to provide suitable advice, conduct reasonable due diligence, and monitor client portfolios. Guaranteeing a minimum rate of return is not part of the duty of care and is, in fact, prohibited. No adviser can guarantee investment results."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "An investor with a long time horizon and high risk tolerance is best suited for a growth-oriented portfolio with a higher allocation to equities (stocks). An 80% stock, 20% bond allocation provides significant growth potential while maintaining some fixed-income diversification. The long time horizon allows recovery from market downturns."

    "correct": 2,

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "R-squared (coefficient of determination) measures the percentage of a portfolio's return that can be explained by the movements of its benchmark index. An R-squared of 100 means the portfolio's returns perfectly correlate with the benchmark. A low R-squared suggests the portfolio behaves differently from its benchmark."

Acting in the clients' best interests and ensuring their accounts are properly managed during the transition", "D. Transferring all client accounts to the departing employee"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The fiduciary duty requires the adviser to act in the best interest of clients at all times, including during employee departures. The adviser must ensure client accounts continue to be properly managed and that clients are informed of any material changes. Disparaging the departing employee or ignoring the situation would not serve clients' interests."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Unsystematic (diversifiable) risk is specific to an individual company or industry. Business risk, such as the risk of a company's product failing, is unsystematic and can be reduced through diversification. Systematic risks like interest rate risk, inflation risk, and market risk affect the entire market and cannot be diversified away."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When an IAR leaves their firm, the firm must file Form U5 (Uniform Termination Notice) through the CRD system within 30 days of termination.

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The efficient frontier is a curve on the risk-return graph representing the set of optimal portfolios that offer the maximum expected return for a given level of risk, or the minimum risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios below the efficient frontier are suboptimal because better risk-return combinations exist."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The fiduciary duty requires full disclosure of all conflicts of interest. A revenue-sharing arrangement with a mutual fund family creates a conflict because the adviser has a financial incentive to recommend those funds over others. The adviser must disclose this arrangement to clients so they can make informed decisions."
