    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "As of May 2024, the standard settlement cycle for most U.S. equity securities is T+1 (trade date plus one business day). This was reduced from T+2 to reduce counterparty risk, decrease margin requirements, and align with technological advancements in trade processing."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In a 1-for-5 reverse stock split, every 5 old shares become 1 new share. A shareholder with 500 shares would have 100 shares (500/5). The stock price adjusts proportionally upward (multiplied by 5) so the total market value remains the same. Reverse splits are often used to raise the per-share price."
