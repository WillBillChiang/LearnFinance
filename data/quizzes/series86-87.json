    "question": "An analyst is evaluating earnings quality and observes that a company's accruals ratio (total accruals / average total assets) is significantly higher than industry peers. This suggests:",
    "choices": [
      "A. The company's earnings are of higher quality than its peers",
      "B. The company may be using aggressive accounting practices, resulting in lower earnings quality",
      "C. The company is generating more cash from operations than peers",
      "D. The company has lower capital expenditures than peers"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A high accruals ratio indicates that a larger proportion of earnings is derived from accruals rather than cash. This is a red flag for earnings quality because accruals involve more management discretion and estimation than cash-based earnings. Academic research has shown that companies with high accruals tend to have less persistent earnings."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Switching from accelerated to straight-line depreciation reduces depreciation expense in the early years of an asset's life, thereby increasing reported earnings. It also results in a higher net book value of assets on the balance sheet since less accumulated depreciation has been recorded. Analysts should recognize this as a potential earnings quality concern."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A P/E premium relative to peers is justified by higher expected earnings growth, superior returns on invested capital, lower risk (lower beta or greater earnings stability), or a combination of these factors. Higher leverage, lower growth, or dividend cuts would typically warrant a discount, not a premium."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An R-squared of 0.92 means that 92% of the variation in the dependent variable (revenue) is explained by the independent variable (consumer spending). Importantly, correlation does not imply causation, and the remaining 8% is explained by other factors. This statistical relationship can help forecast revenue based on macro economic projections."

The tax benefit of additional debt can also increase enterprise value, benefiting equity holders. The net effect depends on the repurchase price and tax shield value."

    "explanation": "Sharing draft research with select clients before publication is a serious violation of fair dealing principles and potentially of securities regulations. The analyst has an ethical obligation to report the violation to compliance immediately. Not reporting observed misconduct can itself be an ethical violation, as professionals have a duty to maintain market integrity."

    "explanation": "IPO spinning is the illegal practice of allocating shares in hot IPOs to corporate executives (such as CEOs who control banking decisions) as an implicit quid pro quo for investment banking business.

    "choices": [
      "A. Simply follow the existing rules as best as possible",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Analysts have an ethical obligation to escalate concerns about compliance deficiencies. This may include reporting to senior management, the firm's board or compliance committee, or external regulators if internal channels are ineffective.

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Selectively disclosing upcoming rating changes to preferred clients violates fair dealing principles, which require equitable dissemination of research. If select clients trade ahead of the public announcement, it may constitute a form of market manipulation or fraud. FINRA Rule 2241 requires that changes in ratings be disseminated fairly."
