    "choices": ["A. Ensure the report generates maximum trading volume", "B. Provide an objective, fair, and honest analysis based on reasonable investigation", "C. Support the firm's investment banking relationships", "D. Recommend only securities the firm underwrites"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Research analysts must provide objective, fair, and honest analysis based on reasonable investigation and due diligence. FINRA Rule 2241 requires that research reports have a reasonable basis and that analysts not subordinate their judgment to investment banking interests. Objectivity and independence are fundamental to research integrity."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "FINRA Rule 2241 requires disclosure of conflicts of interest, including whether the analyst or firm owns securities of the subject company, whether the firm has received investment banking compensation from the company, and whether the analyst received compensation related to investment banking activities. These disclosures help investors evaluate the analyst's objectivity."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS). It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A higher P/E may suggest higher growth expectations, while a lower P/E may indicate value or lower growth prospects."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The DDM values a stock based on the present value of expected future dividends. It is most appropriate for mature companies with stable, predictable dividend payments and consistent payout ratios. It is less suitable for companies that do not pay dividends or have highly unpredictable earnings."

    "choices": ["A. $1.5 billion", "B. $3.0 billion", "C. $6.0 billion", "D. $150 million"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Implied stock price = EPS x P/E = $3.00 x 20 = $60. Market capitalization = Stock price x Shares outstanding = $60 x 50 million = $3.0 billion. This shows how P/E multiples translate to company valuations."

    "choices": ["A. Not publish any research for the entire year", "B. Not publish research on a company for a specified period around an investment banking transaction", "C. Only publish positive research reports", "D. Not communicate with the company's management"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under FINRA Rule 2241, quiet period restrictions prevent research analysts from publishing research reports on a company for specified periods around investment banking transactions. Members that participated as underwriter or dealer in an IPO must observe a minimum 10-calendar-day quiet period; for secondary offerings, managers and co-managers must observe a 3-day quiet period. These restrictions do not apply to Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) or covered investment funds. This protects research integrity and prevents the appearance that research is promoting the firm's investment banking deals."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The Gordon Growth Model (a constant-growth DDM) assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate indefinitely. The formula is: Stock Value = D1 / (k - g), where D1 is the expected next dividend, k is the required rate of return, and g is the constant growth rate. The growth rate must be less than the required return."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity. It measures how effectively management is using shareholders' capital to generate profits. A higher ROE generally indicates more efficient use of equity capital. ROE can be decomposed using the DuPont analysis into profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The DuPont analysis decomposes ROE into: Profit Margin (Net Income/Revenue) x Asset Turnover (Revenue/Total Assets) x Financial Leverage (Total Assets/Equity). This framework helps analysts identify whether ROE is driven by profitability, efficiency, or leverage, providing deeper insight into a company's financial performance."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) of 2.5:1 means the company has $2.50 in current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This liquidity ratio indicates the company's ability to meet short-term obligations. A ratio above 1.0 suggests the company can cover its short-term liabilities."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "FINRA Rule 2241 prohibits investment banking personnel from reviewing, approving, or directing the content of research reports before publication.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EV/EBITDA is capital-structure neutral (because EV accounts for both debt and equity, and EBITDA is pre-interest), tax-rate neutral (EBITDA is pre-tax), and not affected by depreciation policies. This makes it ideal for comparing companies with different financing structures, tax situations, and capital intensity."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Free cash flow represents the cash generated by operations after capital expenditures needed to maintain and grow the business. It is the cash available for distribution to shareholders (dividends, buybacks), debt repayment, and strategic investments. FCF is often considered a more reliable measure than earnings because it is harder to manipulate."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Sum-of-the-parts valuation involves valuing each of a diversified company's business segments independently using appropriate multiples or DCF for each segment, then summing the values. This approach is particularly useful for conglomerates or companies with distinct business lines that trade at different industry multiples."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under FINRA Rule 2241, a research analyst's compensation may not be directly or indirectly linked to specific investment banking transactions. This prevents the conflict of interest where an analyst might issue favorable research to help win investment banking business. Compensation may be based on overall firm profitability or research quality."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Switching from accelerated to straight-line depreciation reduces depreciation expense in the near term (since accelerated methods front-load depreciation). This increases reported earnings but does not change actual cash flows. Analysts should adjust for such accounting changes when comparing performance across periods or companies."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The PEG ratio = P/E ratio / Expected EPS growth rate. A PEG of 1.0 suggests the stock is fairly valued relative to its growth rate. A PEG below 1.0 may indicate undervaluation, while above 1.0 may suggest overvaluation. The PEG ratio helps compare companies with different growth rates."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "High earnings quality is characterized by earnings that closely match operating cash flows, come from recurring core business operations, and are based on conservative accounting assumptions. Low quality earnings may include one-time gains, aggressive revenue recognition, or a significant gap between net income and operating cash flow."

    "explanation": "FINRA Rule 2241 requires research reports to include the definition of each rating category (e.g., buy, hold, sell) and the percentage of the firm's coverage universe in each category.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The two-stage DDM projects dividends in two phases: a high-growth phase (typically 5-10 years) where dividends grow at an above-average rate, followed by a terminal stable-growth phase where dividends grow at a sustainable rate indefinitely. This model is more flexible than the constant-growth DDM for companies transitioning between growth stages."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5:1 means the company has $1.50 of total debt for every $1.00 of shareholders' equity. This leverage ratio measures the extent to which a company is financed by debt versus equity. Higher ratios indicate more financial leverage and potentially greater financial risk."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The residual income model values equity as book value plus the present value of future residual income (earnings in excess of the required return on equity). Residual income = Net Income - (Equity x Cost of Equity). This model is useful when a company does not pay dividends or when cash flows are difficult to predict."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An increasing accounts receivable days (Days Sales Outstanding) ratio suggests the company is taking longer to collect payments from customers.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) is applied to reflect the reduced value of securities that cannot be easily sold in a public market. Private company shares or restricted stock typically receive a DLOM because investors cannot readily liquidate their positions. The discount compensates for the illiquidity risk."
