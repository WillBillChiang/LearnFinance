    "choices": ["A. Revenue from a specific project", "B. The full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuing municipality", "C. Corporate guarantees", "D. Federal government backing"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuing municipality. For local government GO bonds, this typically means property (ad valorem) taxes. For state GO bonds, it means income taxes, sales taxes, or other state revenue sources. GO bonds are considered among the safest municipal securities."

    "choices": ["A. Always rated higher than GO bonds", "B. Backed by the revenue generated from the specific project financed by the bond issue", "C. Issued only by state governments", "D. Exempt from all taxation"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Revenue bonds are secured by the revenue generated from the specific project or facility financed by the bonds, such as toll roads, airports, hospitals, or water systems. They are NOT backed by the taxing power of the issuer. The security depends on the project's ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover debt service."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Municipal bond coupon interest is generally exempt from federal income tax. Additionally, if the bondholder resides in the state where the bond was issued, the interest may also be exempt from state and local income taxes (triple tax-exempt). Capital gains from selling municipal bonds at a profit are still taxable."

    "question": "The debt service coverage ratio for a revenue bond measures:",
    "choices": ["A. The issuer's total outstanding debt", "B. The ratio of net revenue available for debt service to annual debt service requirements", "C. The bond's credit rating", "D. The percentage of the bond that has been repaid"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The debt service coverage ratio equals net revenue (gross revenue minus operating expenses) divided by annual debt service (principal and interest). A ratio greater than 1.0 means the project generates enough revenue to cover debt payments. Higher ratios indicate stronger credit quality. Investors and rating agencies closely monitor this metric."

    "choices": ["A. After debt service", "B. Before debt service from gross revenues", "C. Only from reserve funds", "D. By the state government"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under a net revenue pledge, operating and maintenance expenses are paid first from gross revenues, and the remaining net revenue is then used to pay debt service. This differs from a gross revenue pledge where debt service is paid first from gross revenues before operating expenses. Net revenue pledges are more common."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "MSRB Rule G-30 requires that the prices at which dealers sell municipal securities to customers and the markups or markdowns applied to transactions be fair and reasonable. Factors considered include the fair market value, the expense of executing the transaction, and the availability of the security."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A term bond is a municipal bond where the entire issue matures on a single date. This is in contrast to serial bonds, where portions of the issue mature at regular intervals over time. Term bonds often have a mandatory sinking fund to retire portions of the debt prior to the maturity date."

    "choices": ["A. Most municipal bonds are never called", "B. If the bond is called before maturity, the actual yield received may differ from the yield to maturity", "C. It determines the bond's coupon rate", "D. It is required for tax calculations"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Yield to call is important because if a bond is called before maturity (often when interest rates decline), the investor receives the call price rather than holding to maturity. For premium bonds, the yield to call may be lower than YTM. MSRB rules require that when a bond is quoted at a premium, the lower of YTC or YTM must be disclosed."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under MSRB Rule G-12, the standard settlement for municipal securities in the secondary market is regular way settlement, which is trade date plus one business day (T+1) effective May 28, 2024. For new issues, settlement is typically on the delivery date specified by the underwriter. Cash settlement (same day) is also available."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A double-barreled bond has two sources of security: the revenue from a specific project AND the full faith and credit (taxing power) of the municipal issuer. This provides additional protection to bondholders because if project revenue is insufficient, the issuer's taxing power backs the bonds."

    "choices": ["A. 3.50%", "B. 4.62%", "C. 5.38%", "D. 6.00%"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Tax-equivalent yield = Municipal yield / (1 - tax rate) = 3.5% / (1 - 0.35) = 3.5% / 0.65 = 5.38%. The investor would need to earn 5.38% on a taxable corporate bond to equal the after-tax return of the 3.5% tax-exempt municipal bond."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The typical priority of orders in a municipal bond syndicate is: (1) Presale orders (received before the bid is awarded), (2) Group net orders (benefit the entire syndicate), (3) Designated orders (specified by the buyer for specific syndicate members), and (4) Member and member-related orders. The manager sets this priority in the syndicate agreement."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Moral obligation bonds carry a non-binding commitment from the state legislature to appropriate funds to replenish the debt service reserve if it is drawn down. This commitment is not legally enforceable (hence 'moral' rather than 'legal' obligation), but the state's willingness to step in provides additional credit support."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When a municipal bond is purchased at a premium in the secondary market, the premium must be amortized over the remaining life of the bond. This amortization reduces the bondholder's cost basis each year. Unlike taxable bonds, the amortization of premium on municipal bonds does not create a tax deduction."

    "correct": 1,

Advancing the maturity date of the bonds"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Advance refunding occurs when an issuer sells new bonds more than 90 days before the call date of outstanding bonds. The proceeds are typically invested in U.S. government securities held in escrow until the call date, when the old bonds are redeemed. Current refunding occurs within 90 days of the call date."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A pre-refunded (defeased) municipal bond is backed by U.S. government securities held in escrow, which will generate sufficient funds to pay all debt service and redeem the bonds at the call date.

    "explanation": "Build America Bonds (BABs), created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, are taxable municipal bonds.
