    "choices": ["A. Purchase an option on a commodity", "B. Buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price on a future delivery date", "C. Invest in a mutual fund that holds commodities", "D. Borrow money using commodities as collateral"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A futures contract is a standardized, exchange-traded agreement obligating the buyer to purchase and the seller to deliver a specific quantity and quality of a commodity (or financial instrument) at a predetermined price on a specified future delivery date. Unlike options, futures contracts carry obligations for both parties."

    "choices": ["A. A loan from the broker", "B. A good faith deposit (performance bond) required to open a futures position", "C. The total cost of the futures contract", "D. The maximum potential loss"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Initial margin in futures trading is a good faith deposit (performance bond) required to open a position. It is typically 3-12% of the contract's total value. Unlike stock margin, futures margin is not a loan; it is a deposit ensuring the trader can meet their contractual obligations. The margin is set by the exchange."

    "choices": ["A. Corn prices to decrease", "B. Corn prices to increase", "C. Corn prices to remain unchanged", "D. Corn to be delivered immediately"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A long futures position (buyer) profits when prices increase. The trader has agreed to buy corn at the contract price, so rising prices mean they can sell at a higher price for a profit. Conversely, a short futures position (seller) profits when prices decrease."

    "choices": ["A. Buy wheat futures contracts (go long)", "B. Sell wheat futures contracts (go short)", "C. Buy wheat call options", "D. Buy more wheat seeds"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A wheat farmer (who will sell wheat at harvest) should sell wheat futures contracts (short hedge) to lock in a selling price. If wheat prices fall, the profit on the short futures position offsets the lower cash market price. This is a classic short hedge used by producers to protect against price declines."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A cereal manufacturer (who will buy wheat) should buy wheat futures contracts (long hedge) to lock in a purchase price. If wheat prices rise, the profit on the long futures position offsets the higher cash market price. This is a classic long hedge used by consumers/end users to protect against price increases."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Mark-to-market is the daily settlement process where futures positions are revalued at the end of each trading day. Gains are credited and losses are debited to the trader's margin account. If the account falls below the maintenance margin level, the trader receives a margin call and must deposit additional funds."

    "choices": ["A. The position is automatically closed", "B. The trader receives a margin call and must restore the account to the initial margin level", "C. The exchange lends the trader money", "D. No action is required until the contract expires"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When a margin account falls below the maintenance margin level, the trader receives a margin call requiring them to deposit sufficient funds to bring the account back to the initial margin level (not just the maintenance level). If the margin call is not met, the broker may liquidate the position."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The CFTC is the independent federal agency that regulates the U.S. commodity futures, options on futures, and swaps markets. It was created by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974. The CFTC's mission is to promote market integrity, protect market participants, and prevent fraud and manipulation."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The NFA is the self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the U.S. derivatives industry, including futures, options on futures, and retail forex.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Basis = Cash price - Futures price. Basis can be positive (backwardation) or negative (contango). Hedgers are concerned with basis risk because changes in the basis affect the effectiveness of the hedge. Basis typically converges to zero as the futures contract approaches expiration."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Contango is a market condition where futures prices are higher than the current spot price and increase for more distant delivery months. This typically reflects carrying costs (storage, insurance, financing). The opposite condition is backwardation, where futures prices are below the spot price."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A spread trade involves simultaneously buying one futures contract and selling a related futures contract. Common spreads include calendar spreads (same commodity, different months), inter-commodity spreads (different but related commodities), and inter-market spreads (same commodity, different exchanges). Spreads typically have lower risk and lower margin requirements."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) is a firm that solicits or accepts orders to buy or sell futures contracts, commodity options, or swaps and accepts money or property as margin. FCMs must be registered with the CFTC and NFA. They play a role similar to broker-dealers in the securities industry."

    "choices": ["A. Physical delivery of the commodity", "B. Offset (closing out the position before expiration)", "C. Exchange of futures for physicals", "D. Conversion to options"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The vast majority (approximately 97-98%) of futures contracts are settled by offset, meaning the trader takes an equal and opposite position before expiration to close out their original position. For example, a trader who bought (long) a contract would sell (short) the same contract to close the position."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A short hedge (selling futures) is used by producers, farmers, or owners of a commodity to protect against price declines. By selling futures, they lock in a selling price. If the cash price falls, the gain on the short futures position offsets the lower selling price in the cash market."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An Introducing Broker (IB) solicits and accepts customer orders but does NOT accept money, securities, or property as margin. Instead, the IB introduces customer accounts to a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) that holds customer funds and executes trades. IBs must be registered with the CFTC and NFA."

    "choices": ["A. Guarantee profits for traders", "B. Prevent excessive price movements in a single trading session and maintain orderly markets", "C. Set the final settlement price", "D. Limit trading volume"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Daily price limits restrict how much a futures contract price can move up or down in a single trading session from the previous day's settlement price. This prevents panic-driven excessive moves and provides market participants time to assess information. When a limit is reached, trading may be halted (limit up/limit down)."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A cross-hedge uses a futures contract on a different but correlated commodity when a futures contract on the exact commodity being hedged is not available. For example, a jet fuel producer might use crude oil futures to hedge because there is no liquid jet fuel futures market. Cross-hedges introduce additional basis risk."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A CTA is a person or organization that, for compensation, advises others on the buying or selling of commodity futures contracts, commodity options, or swaps. CTAs may also manage client accounts. They must register with the CFTC and become members of the NFA, and they must provide a disclosure document to prospective clients."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts (either long or short, but not both) that have not been offset by an opposing trade or fulfilled by delivery. It increases when new buyers and sellers enter the market and decreases when existing positions are closed out."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Basis risk is the risk that the relationship between the cash price and the futures price (the basis) may change unfavorably during the hedging period. A hedger replaces price risk with basis risk, which is typically much smaller. Basis risk is higher for cross-hedges and when the delivery month does not align with the hedging period."

    "choices": ["A. Limit order", "B. Market order", "C. Stop-limit order", "D. Fill-or-kill order"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A market order is an order to buy or sell at the best available price. It guarantees execution (the trade will happen) but not the price at which it will be executed, as the market price may move between the time the order is placed and executed. Limit orders guarantee price but not execution."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A bull spread (in most commodities) involves buying the nearby (closer) delivery month and selling the deferred (further out) delivery month. The trader profits if the spread between the two months widens (nearby rises faster or falls slower than the deferred). This reflects a bullish view on near-term supply/demand."
