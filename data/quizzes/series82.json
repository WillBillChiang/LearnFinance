    "choices": ["A. 10", "B. 25", "C. 35", "D. 50"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Rule 506(b) allows an issuer to sell securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors (who must be sophisticated).

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Rule 506(c), added by the JOBS Act, permits general solicitation and advertising in private placements, provided that all purchasers are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify their accredited status. This is a key distinction from Rule 506(b), which prohibits general solicitation."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Securities sold under Regulation D are restricted securities.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Integration is the SEC's concern that an issuer might try to avoid registration requirements by breaking a single offering into multiple smaller ones. If offerings are integrated (treated as one), the combined offering might exceed exemption limits or violate conditions. Factors considered include timing, purpose, type of consideration, and whether the same class of securities is involved."

    "explanation": "A private placement memorandum (PPM) is a disclosure document provided to prospective investors in a private placement.

The PPM describes the investment, risks, management, financials, and terms. It provides important anti-fraud protection for the issuer."
