      "A. The dealer's commission",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When a dealer buys from a customer at 95 and sells to another dealer at 97, the 2-point difference represents the dealer's trading profit from acting as principal. The markdown from the customer (buying below market) and the markup to the other dealer must each be fair and reasonable."
