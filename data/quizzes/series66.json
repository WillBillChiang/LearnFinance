    "choices": ["A. A firm with an office in the state effecting trades", "B. A firm with no office in the state that deals exclusively with institutional clients", "C. A firm soliciting retail clients through cold calls", "D. A firm advertising securities services to residents of the state"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A broker-dealer with no office in the state that deals exclusively with existing institutional clients or other broker-dealers is exempt from state registration. This institutional exemption recognizes that sophisticated investors need less regulatory protection than retail investors."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The state Administrator has administrative authority and cannot impose criminal penalties such as jail sentences. Only courts can impose criminal penalties after prosecution. The Administrator may issue subpoenas, deny or revoke registrations, issue cease and desist orders, and impose administrative fines."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Investment advisers must register with the SEC when AUM reaches $110 million or more. Advisers with AUM between $100-$110 million may register with either the SEC or the state. Advisers with less than $100 million in AUM generally register at the state level unless they qualify for another SEC exemption."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to recommend investments that are suitable for each client based on their individual financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and other relevant factors. The adviser must conduct a thorough analysis of the client's needs before making recommendations."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "When an agent suspects diminished capacity in a senior client, they should follow their firm's procedures for protecting vulnerable adults. This typically includes contacting the designated trusted contact person, placing a temporary hold on suspicious disbursements, and notifying supervisors. FINRA Rule 2165 provides a framework for such situations."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under the Uniform Securities Act, a registration by notification (filing) becomes effective at 3:00 PM Eastern on the second full business day after filing, provided no stop order has been issued and the filing is complete. This is the simplest and fastest registration method, available to established issuers."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An advisory contract cannot contain any provision that requires the client to waive compliance with any portion of the Uniform Securities Act or any other securities law. Such waivers are void and unenforceable. Clients cannot be asked to give up their legal rights and protections."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Material nonpublic information (MNPI) must not be traded on or shared with others. Using MNPI for trading is insider trading, which violates federal securities laws and the Uniform Securities Act.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This describes the limited offering (private placement) exempt transaction under the USA. Offers can be made to up to 10 non-institutional persons in the state during 12 months, the seller reasonably believes buyers are purchasing for investment, and no commissions are paid to non-registered persons. This is a transaction exemption, not a security exemption."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Wrap fee programs require full disclosure, including that the total cost may exceed what the client would pay if services were purchased separately. The adviser must provide a wrap fee brochure (Form ADV Part 2A, Appendix 1) that describes all services included, the total fee, and potential conflicts of interest."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When an agent receives higher compensation for recommending certain products, this creates a conflict of interest that must be disclosed to the client. The client has a right to know that the agent may be incentivized to recommend one product over another. Full disclosure allows the client to evaluate the recommendation in proper context."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Federal covered securities are those subject to federal regulation and generally exempt from state registration. They include exchange-listed securities, registered investment company securities, and Reg D Rule 506 offerings.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A firm may include reasonable confidentiality provisions in settlement agreements but cannot require a client to waive their rights under securities laws or prevent them from contacting regulators.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Consent to service of process is a requirement when registering in a state. By filing the consent, the registrant appoints the state Administrator (or a designated official) as their agent to receive legal documents (lawsuits, subpoenas) on their behalf. This ensures legal process can be served even if the person is out of state."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under the Uniform Securities Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, an advisory contract may not be assigned without the client's consent. Assignment occurs when there is a transfer of the contract or a change in majority ownership of the advisory firm. Client consent is required to protect the client's choice of adviser."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Borrowing money from clients is generally prohibited but may be permitted in limited circumstances, such as when the client is a lending institution or a family member. Even in permitted situations, the firm must have written procedures allowing it and must approve the arrangement. This protects clients from exploitation."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A person convicted of a securities-related felony (or any felony involving dishonesty) within the past 10 years is subject to statutory disqualification.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "An IAR must register in the state where they maintain a place of business. Under the NSMIA and state law, IARs of state-registered advisers register in their state. IARs of SEC-registered advisers register in states where they have a place of business. The definition of 'place of business' is key to determining registration requirements."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "FINRA rules limit gifts to $100 per person per year in the context of securities business. A $150 gift exceeds this limit and should be declined or reported per the firm's gift policy. This rule prevents conflicts of interest and ensures agents make recommendations based on client needs, not personal inducements."
