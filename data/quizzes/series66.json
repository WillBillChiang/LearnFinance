    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Issuers call bonds when interest rates decline significantly because they can refinance at a lower rate. This is similar to a homeowner refinancing a mortgage when rates drop. This presents reinvestment risk to bondholders who must reinvest at lower prevailing rates."

Therefore, the client's cost basis is $50 per share, not the original $20 purchase price. This eliminates the unrealized capital gain that existed during the decedent's lifetime."
