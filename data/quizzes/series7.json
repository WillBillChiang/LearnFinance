    "question": "An investor purchases 100 shares of ABC common stock at $50 per share. The stock pays an annual dividend of $2.00. What is the current yield?",
    "choices": ["A. 2%", "B. 4%", "C. 5%", "D. 10%"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Current yield is calculated as annual dividend divided by market price. $2.00 / $50.00 = 4%. This measures the income return on the investment relative to its current market price."

    "choices": ["A. Preferred stock", "B. Rights", "C. ADRs", "D. Treasury stock"],

    "choices": ["A. 10 million", "B. 9 million", "C. 8 million", "D. 7 million"],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Outstanding shares equal issued shares minus treasury shares. 8 million issued - 1 million treasury = 7 million outstanding. Treasury shares have been repurchased by the company and are no longer considered outstanding."

    "choices": ["A. 5.83%", "B. 6.00%", "C. 6.18%", "D. 3.00%"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Current yield = annual coupon / market price. The annual coupon is $60 (6% of $1,000 par). The market price is $1,030 (103% of par). $60 / $1,030 = 5.83%. When a bond trades at a premium, the current yield is less than the coupon rate."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes (duration) increases with longer maturities and lower coupon rates. A 20-year zero-coupon bond has the longest maturity and no coupon payments, giving it the highest duration and greatest price sensitivity to interest rate changes."

    "choices": ["A. 5.50%", "B. 6.62%", "C. 7.25%", "D. 3.06%"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Tax-equivalent yield = municipal yield / (1 - tax bracket). 4.5% / (1 - 0.32) = 4.5% / 0.68 = 6.62%. This means the investor would need to earn 6.62% on a taxable bond to equal the after-tax return of the 4.5% municipal bond."

    "choices": ["A. $56", "B. $60", "C. $64", "D. $44"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "For a long call, the breakeven point is the strike price plus the premium paid. $60 strike + $4 premium = $64. The stock must rise above $64 for the investor to profit at expiration."

    "choices": ["A. The premium received", "B. The strike price minus the premium", "C. Unlimited", "D. The strike price"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "An uncovered call writer has unlimited loss potential because the stock price can theoretically rise without limit. The writer is obligated to deliver stock at the strike price regardless of how high the market price goes. This is why naked call writing is considered the riskiest options strategy."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A covered call involves owning the underlying stock and selling a call option against it. The premium received provides income, but the upside is capped at the strike price since the stock may be called away. It is a popular income-generating strategy for stockholders."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "General obligation (GO) bonds are backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuing municipality. This means the issuer pledges its ability to levy taxes (property taxes for local GOs, income/sales taxes for state GOs) to pay debt service."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Private activity bonds, which benefit private entities rather than the general public, are typically subject to the AMT. A sports stadium bond primarily benefits a private sports franchise, making it a private activity bond subject to AMT."

    "choices": ["A. The entire discount is taxed as capital gain at maturity", "B. The discount is accreted annually and not taxable", "C. The discount is taxed as ordinary income each year", "D. The discount is not reportable for tax purposes"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "For original issue discount municipal bonds, the discount is accreted (increased) annually, adjusting the cost basis upward toward par. Since the interest on municipal bonds is federally tax-exempt, the accreted OID is also tax-exempt. This differs from market discount bonds."

    "choices": ["A. 5.0%", "B. 5.3%", "C. 5.5%", "D. 4.8%"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The sales charge percentage is calculated based on the public offering price (POP): ($13.16 - $12.50) / $13.16 = $0.66 / $13.16 = 5.0%. By regulation, mutual fund sales charges are always computed as a percentage of the POP, not the NAV."

    "choices": ["A. Shares are redeemed at NAV", "B. Shares trade on an exchange at market price", "C. The fund continuously issues new shares", "D. Sales charges are included in the POP"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares through an IPO, and those shares then trade on an exchange at market price. Unlike open-end funds (mutual funds), closed-end funds do not continuously issue or redeem shares, and they can trade at a premium or discount to NAV."

    "choices": ["A. 5.75%", "B. 8.5%", "C. 9.0%", "D. There is no statutory maximum"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and FINRA rules, the maximum sales charge on a mutual fund is 8.5% of the public offering price. However, this maximum is only permitted if the fund offers breakpoints, rights of accumulation, and reinvestment of dividends at NAV."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible for eligible individuals, reducing current taxable income. The contributions and earnings grow tax-deferred and are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal. This differs from a Roth IRA, where contributions are not deductible but qualified withdrawals are tax-free."

    "choices": ["A. 30 days", "B. 45 days", "C. 60 days", "D. 90 days"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "An indirect rollover from a 401(k) to an IRA must be completed within 60 days to avoid being treated as a taxable distribution. If the funds are not deposited into the IRA within 60 days, the distribution becomes taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if under age 59 1/2. A direct rollover (trustee-to-trustee) avoids these timing issues."

    "choices": ["A. They are tax-deductible", "B. They have no income eligibility limits", "C. They are made with after-tax dollars", "D. They must begin by age 73"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars (not tax-deductible). The benefit is that qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Roth IRAs have income eligibility limits, and unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not have required minimum distributions (RMDs) during the owner's lifetime."

    "choices": ["A. $4", "B. $25", "C. $50", "D. $100"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The conversion price equals the par value divided by the conversion ratio. $100 par / 4 shares = $25 per share. This means each share of preferred stock can be converted into 4 shares of common stock at an effective price of $25 per common share."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "For a long put, the breakeven is the strike price minus the premium paid. $50 - $3 = $47. Below $47, the investor profits. Between $47 and $50, the investor recoups some but not all of the premium. Above $50, the put expires worthless and the investor loses the entire $300 premium."

    "choices": ["A. Coupon > Current Yield > YTM", "B. YTM > Current Yield > Coupon", "C. Current Yield > Coupon > YTM", "D. Coupon > YTM > Current Yield"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "When a bond trades at a premium (above par), the yield relationships from highest to lowest are: Coupon Rate > Current Yield > Yield to Maturity. The coupon is fixed, the current yield is reduced by the higher price, and YTM is the lowest because it accounts for the premium loss as the bond approaches par at maturity."

Failing to inform a client about available breakpoints is a violation known as breakpoint selling. The rep must ensure the investor receives the reduced sales charge they are entitled to."

    "explanation": "The official statement (OS) is the municipal bond equivalent of a corporate prospectus.

    "choices": ["A. $4,800", "B. $7,200", "C. $2,400", "D. $9,600"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The employee contributes 6% of $80,000 = $4,800. The employer matches 50% of that contribution: $4,800 x 50% = $2,400. Total annual contribution = $4,800 + $2,400 = $7,200. Employer matching contributions are a key benefit of 401(k) plans and represent additional compensation to the employee."
