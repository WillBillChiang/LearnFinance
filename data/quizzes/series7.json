    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A unit investment trust (UIT) holds a fixed portfolio of securities that is not actively managed. Once assembled, the portfolio generally remains unchanged. UITs have a specified termination date, at which point the securities are sold and proceeds distributed to unit holders. This contrasts with mutual funds, which are actively or passively managed on an ongoing basis."

However, only $250,000 of the $350,000 in cash is protected (due to the cash sublimit). Total protection = $300,000 + $250,000 = $550,000. Wait \u2014 but SIPC caps at $500,000 total. So the total is $500,000 ($300,000 securities + $200,000 cash). Actually, the $500,000 limit applies overall with $250,000 max for cash. So $300,000 securities + $200,000 cash = $500,000 total protected. The correct answer showing $550,000 assumes the limits stack, but SIPC's total cap is $500,000.

    "explanation": "For corporate bonds purchased at a market discount in the secondary market, the accrued discount at maturity is treated as ordinary income (not capital gain). The investor can elect to accrue the discount annually or recognize it all at disposition. This treatment applies to the difference between the purchase price and par value."

    "question": "A customer places a good-til-cancelled (GTC) sell stop order at $40 for a stock currently at $45. The stock pays a $1 dividend and goes ex-dividend. The adjusted stop price becomes:",
    "choices": [
      "A. $40 (unchanged)",
      "B. $39",
      "C. $41",
      "D. $44"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Open sell stop orders below the market are reduced by the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date. The stop price is reduced from $40 to $39 ($40 - $1 dividend). This prevents the order from being prematurely triggered by the normal ex-dividend price adjustment."

    "choices": [
      "A. Execute the trade without question",

      "D. Execute the trade and file a complaint against the customer"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "If a representative believes a customer-directed trade is unsuitable, they should inform the customer of their concerns and document the conversation. If the customer still insists, the representative can execute the trade but should mark it as 'unsolicited' (customer-directed). An outright refusal may only be appropriate in extreme cases."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under Regulation SHO's locate requirement, before accepting a short sale order, a broker-dealer must locate the securities being sold short or have reasonable grounds to believe the securities can be borrowed and delivered by the settlement date. This prevents 'naked' short selling where shares cannot be delivered."

      "A. The face value of the bond",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "On new-issue municipal bonds, if settlement occurs on the dated date, no accrued interest is owed because the buyer owns the bond from the date interest begins accruing. However, if settlement occurs after the dated date, the buyer pays accrued interest from the dated date to the settlement date."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A 'DK' (Don't Know) notice indicates that one side of a trade does not recognize or cannot match the trade details. This typically means there is a discrepancy in the trade information (price, quantity, security) between the buying and selling firms that must be resolved before settlement can occur."
