    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Before a customer can trade options, a Registered Options Principal must approve the account by reviewing the customer's financial situation, investment objectives, and trading experience. The customer must also sign an options agreement and return it within 15 days of account approval. The ROP ensures the account is suitable for options trading."

    "explanation": "The Options Disclosure Document (ODD), titled 'Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options,' must be delivered to the customer at or before the time the account is approved for options trading.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Options communications must be fair, balanced, and not misleading. The ROP must ensure that all options advertising and correspondence presents risks alongside potential benefits, does not exaggerate returns, and complies with exchange and FINRA rules. Risk disclosure is especially critical for options communications."

    "choices": ["A. Limited risk equal to the premium received", "B. Unlimited potential loss", "C. Maximum loss equal to the strike price", "D. No risk if the option expires out of the money"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An uncovered call writer has unlimited loss potential because the underlying security can theoretically rise without limit. If assigned, the writer must purchase the security at the market price and deliver it at the strike price. The loss equals the market price minus the strike price minus the premium received. This is the riskiest options strategy."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A married put (protective put) involves purchasing stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock. The put acts as insurance against a decline in the stock price, limiting the downside risk to the put's strike price minus the premium paid. The investor retains unlimited upside potential."

    "choices": ["A. Covered call writing", "B. Long puts for hedging", "C. Uncovered (naked) options writing", "D. Buying calls for speculation"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Uncovered (naked) options writing requires the highest approval level because it carries the greatest risk. Covered calls are typically Level 1, long options are Level 2, spreads are Level 3, and naked writing is Level 4. The ROP must ensure that customers are approved only for strategies consistent with their experience and risk tolerance."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A bull call spread (debit spread) involves buying a call with a lower strike price and selling a call with a higher strike price on the same underlying security with the same expiration. Maximum profit is the difference between strikes minus the net premium paid. Maximum loss is the net premium paid."

    "correct": 1,

These limits prevent market manipulation and excessive concentration of risk. Exercise limits typically mirror position limits."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The OCC is the central clearing corporation for all listed options traded on U.S. exchanges. It serves as the counterparty (buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer) for all options contracts, guaranteeing performance.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Uncovered call writing carries unlimited risk and is unsuitable for conservative, income-seeking clients. The ROP must take immediate supervisory action to stop the unsuitable recommendations, review all affected customer accounts for potential harm, and take appropriate disciplinary action against the representative."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A straddle involves simultaneously buying (long straddle) or selling (short straddle) a call and a put with the same strike price, expiration date, and underlying security. A long straddle profits from large price movements in either direction. A short straddle profits when the stock remains near the strike price."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Under Regulation T, buyers of options (long calls or long puts) must pay the full premium (100%) at the time of purchase. Options are not marginable for buyers because they have a fixed, limited life and could become worthless. However, writers (sellers) of options have margin requirements based on the strategy."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A cash-secured put writer deposits enough cash to purchase the stock if assigned. The maximum loss occurs if the stock falls to zero: the writer must buy at the strike price, having already received the premium. Maximum loss = (Strike Price - Premium) x 100 shares. The maximum gain is the premium received."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "All customer complaints must be documented, investigated, and responded to in accordance with the firm's procedures and FINRA rules.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An iron condor combines a short out-of-the-money put spread (bull put spread) with a short out-of-the-money call spread (bear call spread). The strategy profits when the underlying stays within a range defined by the short strikes. Maximum profit is the net credit received; maximum loss is limited by the long options."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "LEAPS are long-term options with expiration dates up to three years in the future, compared to standard options which typically expire within a few months.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Time decay (theta) accelerates as options approach expiration, and its impact is greatest on at-the-money options. At-the-money options have the highest time value, so they lose the most value as expiration approaches. Deep in-the-money options have mostly intrinsic value, and deep out-of-the-money options have little value to lose."

    "explanation": "Options account suitability must be reviewed on an ongoing basis, not just at account opening. The firm must update customer information periodically and whenever there is a known material change in the customer's financial situation, investment objectives, or risk tolerance.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The maximum gain on a long put occurs when the underlying stock falls to zero. The gain equals the strike price minus the premium paid (times 100 shares per contract). For example, a long put at strike 50 with premium of 3 has a maximum gain of ($50 - $3) x 100 = $4,700."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Large concentrated options positions should trigger supervisory review by the ROP to assess concentration risk, verify compliance with position and exercise limits, evaluate suitability, and determine whether the positions pose undue risk to the customer or the firm.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Index options are settled in cash rather than by physical delivery of securities. When an index option is exercised, the holder receives the cash difference between the strike price and the index value. This is because it is impractical to deliver all the component securities of an index. Equity options are settled by delivery of the underlying stock."
