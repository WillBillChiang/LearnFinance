    "question": "Which of the following best describes an open-end investment company?",
    "choices": ["A. It issues a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange", "B. It continuously offers and redeems shares at NAV", "C. It invests exclusively in government bonds", "D. It is exempt from SEC registration"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An open-end investment company (mutual fund) continuously offers new shares to investors and redeems existing shares at the net asset value (NAV). This distinguishes them from closed-end funds, which issue a fixed number of shares that trade on exchanges."

    "choices": ["A. $12.00", "B. $12.50", "C. $13.00", "D. $11.50"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "NAV per share = (Total Assets - Liabilities) / Shares Outstanding = ($500M - $20M) / 40M = $480M / 40M = $12.00. NAV is calculated at the close of each business day and represents the per-share value of the fund's net assets."

    "choices": ["A. The investor pays a back-end load upon redemption", "B. The investor pays a front-end sales charge at the time of purchase", "C. The investor pays higher ongoing 12b-1 fees than Class C shares", "D. There are no sales charges of any kind"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Class A shares charge a front-end sales charge (load) at the time of purchase, reducing the initial investment. They typically have lower ongoing 12b-1 fees compared to Class B or C shares. Class A shares also offer breakpoint discounts for larger purchases."

    "choices": ["A. Class A shares", "B. Class B shares", "C. Class C shares", "D. All classes are equally appropriate"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Class A shares are most appropriate for large lump-sum investments because breakpoint discounts reduce the front-end sales charge as the investment amount increases. Class B shares have back-end loads and higher 12b-1 fees, while Class C shares have level loads with no breakpoints."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A letter of intent allows an investor to qualify for breakpoint discounts by committing to invest a specific amount over a 13-month period. If the investor does not fulfill the LOI, the fund will retroactively charge the higher sales charge on previous purchases."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Variable annuity earnings grow on a tax-deferred basis during the accumulation phase. No taxes are owed until withdrawals begin. Upon withdrawal, earnings are taxed as ordinary income (not capital gains). This tax-deferred growth is a primary benefit of annuity products."

    "choices": ["A. Investment in separate accounts", "B. Guaranteed fixed rate of return", "C. Death benefit for beneficiaries", "D. Tax-deferred growth"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Variable annuities do NOT guarantee a fixed rate of return. The returns depend on the performance of the underlying separate account investments chosen by the contract owner. A fixed annuity provides guaranteed returns. Variable annuities do offer tax-deferred growth, separate account investments, and typically a death benefit."

    "choices": ["A. $0", "B. $20,000", "C. $30,000", "D. $50,000"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Variable annuity withdrawals follow the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method for tax purposes. Earnings are considered withdrawn first. Since there is $50,000 in earnings ($150,000 - $100,000), the entire $30,000 withdrawal is taxable as ordinary income because it comes entirely from earnings."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Variable annuity separate accounts are considered securities and must be registered under both the Securities Act of 1933 (governs the offering of the contract) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (governs the separate account as an investment company). The annuity contract itself is also an insurance product regulated by state insurance departments."

    "choices": ["A. The current account value or total premiums paid, whichever is greater", "B. Always the current account value regardless of premiums paid", "C. Zero, because variable annuities have no death benefit", "D. The total premiums paid plus a fixed interest rate"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Most variable annuity contracts include a standard death benefit that pays the beneficiary the greater of the current account value or the total premiums paid (minus any withdrawals). This guarantees beneficiaries will receive at least the amount invested even if the account has declined in value."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "529 plan qualified withdrawals used for eligible education expenses (tuition, fees, room and board, books) are free from federal income tax. Contributions are not federally tax-deductible, though some states offer state tax deductions. Anyone can open a 529 plan for a beneficiary, and investments are not guaranteed."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Non-qualified withdrawals from a 529 plan result in the earnings portion being subject to ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty on the earnings. The original contribution (basis) is not subject to tax or penalty since it was made with after-tax dollars."

    "choices": ["A. Daily", "B. Monthly", "C. Twice per calendar year", "D. Once per calendar year"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under federal rules, 529 plan account owners may change investment options (reallocate existing investments) up to twice per calendar year. However, new contributions can be directed to any available investment option at any time. This rule prevents excessive trading within the accounts."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Money market funds are not permitted to charge front-end sales loads (sales charges). They may charge 12b-1 fees within regulatory limits. Money market funds typically invest in short-term, high-quality instruments like commercial paper, Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements while seeking to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A balanced fund invests in both stocks and bonds, typically maintaining a relatively fixed allocation between the two asset classes.

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Under FINRA rules, 12b-1 fees (asset-based distribution fees) cannot exceed 1% of average net assets annually, with a maximum of 0.75% for distribution and 0.25% for service fees. These are ongoing fees deducted from fund assets to cover marketing, distribution, and shareholder service costs."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "During the annuity (payout) phase of a variable annuity, the payment amount is determined by comparing the actual performance of the separate account to the assumed interest rate (AIR). If returns exceed the AIR, payments increase. If returns fall below the AIR, payments decrease."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "529 plans allow a special gift tax election where a lump-sum contribution of up to 5 times the annual gift tax exclusion can be spread over 5 years for gift tax purposes. At $19,000 per year (2025 exclusion amount), that allows up to $95,000 without using the lifetime gift tax exemption. The donor must file a gift tax return electing this treatment."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A 70-year-old retiree needing current income would be the least suitable investor for a growth fund. Growth funds invest primarily in stocks with capital appreciation potential but typically provide little current income through dividends. A retiree needing income would be better served by income funds or bond funds."

    "correct": 1,

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Withdrawals from a variable annuity before age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the earnings portion, in addition to ordinary income tax.

    "explanation": "If a 529 plan beneficiary receives a scholarship, the account owner may withdraw an amount up to the scholarship without paying the 10% penalty.

    "choices": ["A. Remain constant throughout the contract", "B. Increase over time", "C. Decrease over time and eventually disappear", "D. Apply only to contributions made in the first year"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Surrender charges (contingent deferred sales charges) on variable annuities typically decline over a period of years (e.g., 7% in year one, decreasing by 1% each year) and eventually reach zero. This declining schedule encourages long-term holding and compensates the insurance company for upfront sales costs."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Mutual funds cannot distribute interest from unrealized gains because unrealized gains have not been received as income. Funds can distribute dividends from net investment income, capital gains from the sale of portfolio securities, and return of capital (which reduces cost basis). Unrealized gains only become distributable once the securities are sold."
