    "question": "An investor purchased mutual fund shares at $20 per share. The fund paid $2 in dividends that were reinvested. The current NAV is $25. What is the investor's cost basis per original share for tax purposes (assuming reinvestment at $22 per share)?",

      "A. $20",

      "C. $25",
      "D. $20 for original shares, plus $22 for reinvested shares"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The cost basis for the original shares remains $20 per share. Reinvested dividends create new shares with a cost basis equal to the reinvestment price ($22). Both amounts of shares have their own cost basis. The investor is taxed on the $2 dividend when distributed, regardless of reinvestment."

      "D. It eliminates all investment risk"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Dollar-cost averaging results in a lower average cost per share compared to the average price per share because more shares are purchased when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.

    "explanation": "For non-qualified annuity withdrawals, the IRS applies a last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, meaning earnings are deemed to be withdrawn first. Since the account has $40,000 in earnings ($120,000 - $80,000), the entire $20,000 withdrawal is considered earnings and taxed as ordinary income.

    "choices": [
      "A. Simply process the exchange without additional analysis",
      "B. Evaluate whether the exchange is in the customer's best interest, considering surrender charges, fees, and benefits of both contracts",

      "D. Only consider the new contract's features"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "FINRA Rule 2330 requires that before recommending a variable annuity exchange, the representative must have a reasonable basis to believe the transaction is suitable. This includes evaluating surrender charges on the existing contract, new surrender periods, changes in death benefits, and whether the new features justify the costs."

    "question": "An investor holds shares in a growth mutual fund and a bond fund. The growth fund has declined 15% while the bond fund has gained 5%. A representative suggests rebalancing the portfolio. This strategy involves:",
    "choices": [
      "A. Selling all investments and moving to cash",
      "B. Selling some of the outperforming asset and buying more of the underperforming asset to restore the target allocation",
      "C. Only buying more of the growth fund",
      "D. Ignoring the portfolio until it recovers"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Rebalancing involves returning a portfolio to its target asset allocation by selling portions of overweight positions and buying underweight positions. This disciplined approach helps maintain the intended risk level and may enhance long-term returns by systematically buying low and selling high."

      "B. Fund B",
      "C. Both will decline equally",
      "D. Neither will decline"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Fund B (20-year average maturity) will decline more in value because longer-maturity bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes. When rates rise, long-term bond prices fall more than short-term bond prices. This is known as interest rate risk or duration risk."
