    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The lead underwriter (bookrunner) manages all aspects of the IPO process including conducting due diligence, preparing the registration statement, structuring the offering, building the book, pricing the shares, and coordinating distribution. The lead underwriter assumes the greatest responsibility and risk in the syndicate."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "During the cooling-off period (between filing the registration statement and its effective date), the underwriter may distribute the preliminary prospectus (red herring) and accept indications of interest. No binding sales or offers to sell may occur. This period allows investors to review the offering materials."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The DCF method values a company by projecting its future free cash flows and discounting them back to present value using an appropriate discount rate (typically the weighted average cost of capital - WACC). This intrinsic valuation method captures the time value of money and the company's growth potential."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Enterprise value represents the total value of a business to all capital providers. It is calculated as market capitalization (equity value) plus total debt (including preferred stock and minority interest) minus cash and cash equivalents. EV is used in ratios like EV/EBITDA for company comparisons."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A fairness opinion is provided by an independent financial advisor to the board of directors, stating that the consideration offered in a transaction is fair from a financial point of view to the shareholders. It does not guarantee the price is the best possible, only that it falls within a range of fairness. Boards often rely on fairness opinions for fiduciary duty protection."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under SEC Rule 14e-1, a tender offer must remain open for at least 20 business days. If the terms of the tender offer change (such as price or percentage sought), the offer must remain open for at least 10 business days from the date of the change. Shareholders also have withdrawal rights during this period."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Comparable company analysis involves identifying similar publicly traded companies and comparing their valuation multiples (such as P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue) to derive an implied valuation for the target company. This market-based approach reflects current market conditions and investor sentiment."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A green shoe (overallotment) option allows the underwriter to purchase additional shares from the issuer (typically up to 15% of the original offering size) to cover overallotments and stabilize the stock price in the aftermarket. This mechanism helps support the offering price during the initial trading period."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In a leveraged buyout, the acquisition is financed primarily through debt, typically using the target company's assets and future cash flows as collateral. The acquirer (often a private equity firm) uses a relatively small amount of equity and substantial borrowed funds, with the goal of generating returns through operational improvements and eventual exit."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "WACC represents the blended cost of a company's debt and equity financing, weighted by their respective proportions in the capital structure. It serves as the discount rate in DCF analysis to convert projected future free cash flows to present value. WACC reflects the minimum return required by all capital providers."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A shelf registration under SEC Rule 415 allows well-known seasoned issuers (WKSIs) and other eligible issuers to register a large amount of securities in advance and then sell them in portions over time (up to three years) as market conditions are favorable. This provides flexibility and reduces issuance costs."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act requires parties to certain mergers and acquisitions to file pre-merger notification with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) before completing the transaction.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Precedent transaction analysis examines valuation multiples paid in previous M&A transactions involving similar companies. Unlike trading comps (which use current market data), deal comps incorporate control premiums paid by acquirers. This methodology reflects what buyers have actually been willing to pay, including synergy value."

    "correct": 1,

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "An accretive acquisition increases the acquirer's earnings per share (EPS) after the transaction closes. This occurs when the earnings added by the target exceed the cost of financing the acquisition (whether through debt interest or dilution from new shares). Accretion/dilution analysis is a key metric in evaluating proposed M&A transactions."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Terminal value captures the value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period (typically 5-10 years). It is usually calculated using either the perpetuity growth method (Gordon Growth Model) or the exit multiple method. Terminal value typically represents a significant portion (often 60-80%) of the total enterprise value in a DCF analysis."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A reverse merger is a transaction where a private company merges with or acquires an existing publicly traded shell company, thereby becoming publicly traded without going through a traditional IPO process. This can be faster and less expensive than an IPO, though the company must still meet ongoing SEC reporting requirements."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "SEC Regulation M prohibits underwriters, issuers, and other distribution participants from engaging in bids or purchases that could artificially influence the market price of a security during a distribution.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Synergies represent the additional value created when two companies combine, where the combined entity is worth more than the sum of the two standalone companies. Synergies can be cost synergies (eliminating redundancies, economies of scale) or revenue synergies (cross-selling, expanded market reach). Quantifying synergies is crucial in justifying acquisition premiums."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EV/EBITDA is preferred because it is capital structure neutral (not affected by differences in debt levels) and eliminates differences in depreciation and amortization policies. This makes it more useful for comparing companies with different capital structures, tax situations, and asset bases. P/E is affected by capital structure, taxes, and depreciation."

Requires regulatory approval for all stock trades"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A poison pill allows existing shareholders (other than the hostile acquirer) to purchase additional shares at a substantial discount if any entity acquires a specified percentage of the company's stock. This massively dilutes the acquirer's ownership position, making the hostile takeover prohibitively expensive."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) = EBIT(1-tax rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures - Changes in Net Working Capital. FCFF represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) after funding operations and investments. It is the cash flow used in an unlevered DCF."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The exchange ratio in a stock-for-stock merger is calculated by dividing the agreed offer price per target share by the acquirer's current stock price. For example, if the offer price is $50 and the acquirer's stock trades at $100, the exchange ratio is 0.5 (each target share receives 0.5 acquirer shares). The ratio may be fixed or floating depending on the merger agreement."
