    "explanation": "A callable bond benefits the issuer, who can redeem (call) the bond before maturity, typically when interest rates have fallen, allowing the issuer to refinance at lower rates. This disadvantages the bondholder who loses the higher-yielding investment. The yield to call is typically lower (not higher) than YTM for a premium bond (C). The issuer still pays interest up to the call date (D)."

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "SMA = Equity - Reg T Requirement. Equity = $100,000 - $50,000 = $50,000. Reg T requirement = 50% \u00d7 $100,000 = $50,000. SMA = $50,000 - $50,000 = $0. The account is exactly at the Reg T requirement, so no excess equity exists. There is no SMA available for additional purchases."
