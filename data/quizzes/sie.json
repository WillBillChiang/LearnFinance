    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees broker-dealers and their registered representatives. The SEC is a government agency, not an SRO. The FRB is the central banking system. The MSRB is also an SRO, but it only writes rules for the municipal securities market and does not directly oversee or enforce compliance by broker-dealers — that enforcement is carried out by FINRA, the SEC, and bank regulators."

To combat rising inflation, the Federal Reserve typically raises the federal funds rate target, which increases borrowing costs and slows economic activity. Lowering the discount rate, purchasing securities, and lowering reserve requirements are all expansionary monetary policy tools that would increase the money supply and potentially worsen inflation."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, meaning earnings are not taxed until distributions are taken, typically in retirement. Contributions may also be tax-deductible depending on income and other factors. Individual brokerage accounts, joint accounts, and TOD accounts are taxable accounts where investment earnings are subject to taxes in the year they are realized."

    "choices": [
      "A. A market order",
      "B. A stop order",
      "C. A limit order",
      "D. A stop-limit order"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. A limit order specifies the maximum price (for buy orders) or minimum price (for sell orders) at which the customer is willing to execute. 'Buy at $45 or better' means the investor will pay no more than $45 per share. A market order would execute at the best available price with no price restriction. Stop orders become market orders when triggered."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. As of May 28, 2024, regular-way settlement for most securities transactions — including corporate stocks, bonds, and municipal securities — is T+1 (trade date plus one business day). This means if a trade is executed on Monday, settlement occurs on Tuesday. U.S. government securities and options also settle T+1."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Regulation T, set by the Federal Reserve Board, requires an initial margin deposit of 50% of the purchase price of securities bought on margin. For a $20,000 purchase, the customer must deposit $10,000 (50% x $20,000), and the remaining $10,000 can be borrowed from the broker-dealer as a margin loan."

Making an unsuitable recommendation involves suggesting investments that do not align with a customer's stated investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance, and other relevant factors. Recommending speculative stocks for a conservative retiree's entire savings is clearly unsuitable. Churning involves excessive trading, front-running is trading ahead of a customer order, and insider trading is trading on material nonpublic information."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Short selling requires a margin account because the customer is borrowing shares from the broker-dealer to sell them, with the obligation to return the shares later. The customer does not own the stock (that would be a long sale). Written permission from the issuer is not required. Short selling is available to both retail and institutional investors."

Churning is the prohibited practice of a registered representative excessively trading in a customer's account primarily to generate commissions rather than to benefit the customer. The representative must have control over the account (discretionary authority or de facto control). An investor trading their own account cannot be churned because they control the trading."
