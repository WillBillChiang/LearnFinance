    "back": "The Series 9/10 qualifies a principal to supervise sales activities including options but not investment banking, market making, or financial operations. The Series 24 is a broader principal license covering most BD supervisory activities except options. A firm may require both licenses for comprehensive supervisory authority. The Series 9/10 focuses specifically on sales practice supervision."

    "back": "KYC requires broker-dealers to understand the essential facts about every customer, including their financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and experience.

    "front": "What constitutes excessive trading (churning)?",
    "back": "Churning is excessive trading in a customer's account to generate commissions rather than serve the customer's interest. Indicators include high turnover ratios (annualized cost-to-equity ratio above 6% is presumptive), in-and-out trading, high commission-to-equity ratios, and transactions inconsistent with the customer's stated objectives. Supervisors must monitor these metrics."

    "back": "Unauthorized trading occurs when a representative executes transactions without the customer's prior knowledge or consent in a non-discretionary account. This is a serious violation that can result in disciplinary action, customer complaints, and arbitration.
