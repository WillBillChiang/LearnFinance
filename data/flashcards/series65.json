    "back": "Investment advisers with $100 million or more in assets under management (AUM) must register with the SEC. Advisers with less than $100 million AUM generally register with the state(s) where they have a place of business. Advisers between $100-110 million may register with either. This division is established by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended."

    "back": "Fiduciary duty requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of their clients at all times. This includes the duty of loyalty (putting client interests first), duty of care (providing competent and diligent advice), and the obligation to disclose all material conflicts of interest. Fiduciary duty is the highest legal standard of care."

    "back": "Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz, is a framework for constructing portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk through diversification. MPT demonstrates that portfolio risk can be reduced by combining assets with low or negative correlations. The efficient frontier represents the set of portfolios offering the highest return for each risk level."

    "back": "CAPM describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. The formula is: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta x (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). It asserts that the only risk rewarded by the market is systematic (non-diversifiable) risk, measured by beta. CAPM is used to determine the required rate of return for an investment."

    "front": "What is beta in investment analysis?",
    "back": "Beta measures a security's sensitivity to market movements (systematic risk). A beta of 1.0 means the security moves in line with the market. A beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility. Beta is used in the CAPM to calculate expected return and assess portfolio risk."

    "back": "Alpha measures a portfolio's risk-adjusted excess return compared to a benchmark. A positive alpha indicates the portfolio outperformed its expected return based on its risk level (beta), while a negative alpha indicates underperformance. Alpha is used to evaluate a portfolio manager's skill in generating returns beyond what is explained by market movements."

    "topicName": "Portfolio Management",
    "front": "What is the Sharpe ratio?",
    "back": "The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return by calculating the excess return per unit of total risk (standard deviation). The formula is: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. It uses total risk (not just systematic risk), making it useful for evaluating undiversified portfolios."

    "back": "Systematic risk (market risk) affects the entire market and cannot be eliminated through diversification; it includes interest rate, inflation, and political risks. Unsystematic risk (company-specific risk) is unique to a particular company or industry and can be reduced through diversification. Total risk equals systematic plus unsystematic risk."

    "back": "The business cycle consists of four phases: expansion (rising GDP, employment, and consumer spending), peak (maximum economic output before decline), contraction/recession (declining GDP for two consecutive quarters, rising unemployment), and trough (lowest point before recovery begins). Understanding the cycle helps advisers make appropriate investment recommendations."

    "front": "What is the yield curve and what does its shape indicate?",
    "back": "The yield curve plots interest rates of bonds with equal credit quality across different maturities. A normal (upward-sloping) curve indicates longer maturities have higher yields. An inverted curve (short-term rates exceed long-term rates) is often a predictor of recession. A flat curve suggests economic uncertainty and may precede a transition in monetary policy."

    "front": "What is the Federal Reserve's dual mandate?",
    "back": "The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). To achieve these goals, the Fed uses monetary policy tools including setting the federal funds rate target, conducting open market operations, adjusting the discount rate, and paying interest on reserve balances (IORB). Note: Reserve requirements were reduced to zero in March 2020 and are no longer actively used. Balancing these two objectives requires the Fed to manage trade-offs between economic growth and inflation."

    "back": "Asset allocation is the strategy of dividing a portfolio among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, alternatives) based on the investor's goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Research suggests that asset allocation is the primary determinant of portfolio returns over time. Strategic allocation sets long-term targets, while tactical allocation makes short-term adjustments."

    "back": "Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where a fixed dollar amount is invested at regular intervals regardless of market conditions. This results in purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, potentially reducing the average cost per share over time. It does not guarantee profits or protect against losses in declining markets."

    "back": "A hedge fund is a private investment partnership that uses advanced strategies such as leverage, short selling, derivatives, and concentrated positions to generate returns. Hedge funds are generally available only to accredited investors and qualified purchasers. They typically charge a management fee plus a performance fee (commonly '2 and 20') and have limited liquidity."

    "back": "A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing real estate. REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income as dividends to shareholders. They provide investors with exposure to real estate without direct property ownership, offer liquidity (for publicly traded REITs), and diversification benefits. REIT dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income."

    "back": "SEC-registered investment advisers must adopt a written code of ethics that sets standards of conduct, requires reporting of personal securities transactions by access persons, requires pre-approval for IPO and limited offering participation, and addresses insider trading policies. The code must be provided to all supervised persons and enforced by a chief compliance officer."

    "back": "The custody rule requires investment advisers who have custody of client funds or securities to maintain them with a qualified custodian, send account statements to clients at least quarterly, and undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant. These protections ensure client assets are safeguarded against misuse or misappropriation."

    "back": "An adviser has custody if it directly or indirectly holds client funds or securities, has authority to obtain possession of them, or has the ability to deduct fees from client accounts. Standing letters of authorization, trustee roles, and certain bill-pay arrangements may also constitute custody. Having custody triggers enhanced regulatory requirements."

    "back": "Standard deviation measures the total variability (volatility) of a portfolio's returns from its mean return. A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility and risk. It captures both systematic and unsystematic risk, making it a measure of total risk. The Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation to evaluate risk-adjusted performance."

    "back": "Fiscal policy is set by Congress and the President through government spending and taxation decisions. Monetary policy is set by the Federal Reserve through interest rates, open market operations, the discount rate, and interest on reserve balances (IORB). Note: Reserve requirements have been at zero since March 2020 and are no longer an active tool. Both policies influence economic growth and inflation, but they operate through different mechanisms and are controlled by different government entities."
