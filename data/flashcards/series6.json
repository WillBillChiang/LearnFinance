    "front": "What is a mutual fund?",
    "back": "A mutual fund is an open-end investment company that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities. Shares are purchased and redeemed at the fund's net asset value (NAV), calculated at the end of each business day. Mutual funds offer professional management, diversification, and liquidity to individual investors."

    "front": "What is a sales charge (load) on a mutual fund?",
    "back": "A sales charge or load is a commission paid when purchasing (front-end load) or redeeming (back-end load) mutual fund shares. Front-end loads reduce the amount invested, while back-end loads (contingent deferred sales charges) are charged upon redemption and typically decrease over time. No-load funds do not charge sales commissions but may have other fees."

    "front": "What is a breakpoint in mutual fund sales charges?",
    "back": "A breakpoint is a dollar amount at which the sales charge on a mutual fund purchase is reduced. As the investment amount increases, the sales charge percentage decreases at specified levels. Breakpoint schedules are disclosed in the prospectus. Selling shares just below a breakpoint to earn a higher commission (breakpoint selling) is a FINRA violation."

    "front": "What is a letter of intent (LOI) for mutual fund purchases?",
    "back": "A letter of intent allows an investor to receive a reduced sales charge by committing to invest a specified amount in a mutual fund over a 13-month period. The investor receives the breakpoint discount from the first purchase. If the investor fails to meet the commitment, the fund retroactively applies the higher sales charge."

    "topicName": "Mutual Funds",
    "front": "What are rights of accumulation in mutual funds?",
    "back": "Rights of accumulation allow an investor to qualify for breakpoint discounts based on the total current value of existing holdings plus new purchases, rather than just the new purchase amount. This means as an investor's account grows, they may qualify for reduced sales charges on subsequent purchases without needing a letter of intent."

    "front": "What is a 12b-1 fee?",
    "back": "A 12b-1 fee is an annual marketing or distribution fee charged by a mutual fund, named after the SEC rule that permits it. These fees are deducted from fund assets and cover advertising, distribution, and sometimes shareholder servicing costs. FINRA limits 12b-1 fees to 1% of average net assets, with no more than 0.75% for distribution and 0.25% for service."

    "front": "What is the expense ratio of a mutual fund?",
    "back": "The expense ratio is the annual percentage of fund assets used to pay operating expenses, including management fees, 12b-1 fees, and administrative costs. A lower expense ratio means more of the investor's money is working in the market. Index funds typically have lower expense ratios than actively managed funds."

    "front": "What is a variable annuity?",
    "back": "A variable annuity is an insurance contract that offers tax-deferred growth and a series of payments that vary based on the performance of underlying investment subaccounts. During the accumulation phase, the investor's contributions are invested in subaccounts similar to mutual funds. Variable annuities are considered securities and require FINRA registration."

    "topicName": "Variable Annuities",
    "front": "What are the two phases of a variable annuity?",
    "back": "The accumulation phase is when the investor makes contributions and the account grows tax-deferred. The annuitization (payout) phase is when the contract converts to a stream of income payments. During annuitization, payments consist of a return of the investor's cost basis (not taxed) and earnings (taxed as ordinary income)."

    "back": "Earnings withdrawn from a variable annuity are taxed as ordinary income (not capital gains), and withdrawals are considered earnings-first (LIFO) for tax purposes. Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty in addition to ordinary income tax. The original investment (cost basis) is returned tax-free."

    "front": "What is a surrender charge on a variable annuity?",
    "back": "A surrender charge is a fee imposed by the insurance company if the annuity owner withdraws funds or surrenders the contract within a specified period, typically 5-10 years. The charge usually decreases over time on a declining schedule. Most contracts allow penalty-free withdrawals of up to 10% per year during the surrender period."

    "back": "The death benefit guarantees that if the annuity owner dies during the accumulation phase, beneficiaries receive at least the total amount of premiums paid minus withdrawals, or the current contract value, whichever is greater. Some contracts offer enhanced death benefits that lock in higher values periodically. This benefit is provided by the insurance company."

    "topicName": "Variable Annuities",
    "front": "What are accumulation units and annuity units?",
    "back": "Accumulation units represent the investor's ownership interest during the accumulation phase, similar to mutual fund shares. When the contract is annuitized, accumulation units are converted into annuity units, which determine the amount of each payment. The number of annuity units is fixed, but the value of each unit varies with investment performance."

    "back": "Variable life insurance is a permanent life insurance policy with a fixed premium, a guaranteed minimum death benefit, and a cash value that fluctuates based on the performance of underlying investment subaccounts chosen by the policyholder. It is considered both an insurance product and a security, requiring registration with the SEC and a prospectus."

    "back": "Variable universal life combines features of variable life and universal life insurance. It offers flexible premiums, an adjustable death benefit, and a cash value invested in subaccounts that fluctuate with market performance. Unlike variable life, VUL allows policyholders to increase or decrease premiums and death benefits within certain limits."

Non-qualified withdrawals are subject to income tax on earnings plus a 10% penalty. Recent legislation also allows 529 funds to repay student loans up to $10,000."

    "back": "529 plan contributions are treated as gifts for federal gift tax purposes. Contributors can use 5-year gift tax averaging, allowing them to contribute up to five times the annual gift tax exclusion in a single year without incurring gift tax. This makes 529 plans a powerful estate planning tool, as the contributions are removed from the donor's estate."

    "back": "An exchange privilege allows investors to switch from one fund to another within the same fund family, usually at NAV without an additional sales charge. However, exchanges are taxable events, meaning the investor must recognize gains or losses on the exchanged shares. Excessive exchanges may indicate unsuitable mutual fund switching."

The formula is POP = NAV / (1 - Sales Charge %). For example, if NAV is $10 and the sales charge is 5%, the POP is $10 / 0.95 = $10.53."

    "back": "Mutual fund switching is the practice of recommending that a customer sell shares in one fund family to purchase shares in another fund family. This can be problematic because the investor may incur new sales charges, lose breakpoint discounts, and trigger taxable events. Switching must be justified by a material benefit to the customer and is closely scrutinized by regulators."
