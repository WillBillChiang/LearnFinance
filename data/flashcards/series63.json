    "back": "The three methods are: (1) Registration by notification (filing) for established issuers meeting certain criteria, (2) Registration by coordination, filed simultaneously with a federal registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and (3) Registration by qualification, used when other methods are unavailable, requiring the most detailed disclosure."

    "back": "Registration by coordination is used when a security is being registered at both the federal and state levels simultaneously. The issuer files a registration statement with the state that coordinates with the federal SEC filing. The state registration becomes effective at the same time as the federal registration, provided certain conditions are met."

    "front": "What is consent to service of process?",
    "back": "Consent to service of process is a legal document filed with the state Administrator that appoints the Administrator as the registrant's agent for receiving legal notices and lawsuits. This ensures that non-resident broker-dealers, agents, and investment advisers can be served with legal process through the Administrator, simplifying enforcement actions."

    "back": "Selling away occurs when a registered agent engages in private securities transactions outside the scope of their employment with their broker-dealer, without the broker-dealer's knowledge and approval.

    "back": "The USA defines a security broadly to include stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, investment contracts, certificates of interest, and any instrument commonly known as a security.

    "back": "An unsolicited transaction is one initiated by the customer without any recommendation or suggestion from the agent. Unsolicited transactions are exempt from state registration requirements. The agent should mark the order ticket as unsolicited to document that the transaction was customer-initiated. However, anti-fraud provisions still apply to all transactions."

The issuer must reasonably believe buyers are purchasing for investment."

    "back": "Commingling occurs when an agent or adviser mixes client funds with their own personal funds or with the firm's funds. This is strictly prohibited under the USA. Client funds must be kept in separate, properly labeled accounts. Commingling makes it difficult to identify and protect client assets and is considered a fraudulent practice."

    "back": "A place of business is any location where a broker-dealer, agent, or investment adviser regularly provides securities services.

    "back": "Rescission is a legal remedy that returns parties to their pre-transaction positions. In securities law, it means the seller must refund the purchase price plus interest to the buyer, and the buyer returns the security. A seller who discovers a violation may offer rescission to the buyer; if the buyer rejects the offer within 30 days, the buyer may lose the right to sue."
