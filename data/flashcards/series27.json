    "front": "What is the purpose of the net capital rule (SEC Rule 15c3-1)?",
    "back": "The net capital rule requires broker-dealers to maintain minimum levels of net liquid assets to ensure they can meet obligations to customers and creditors. It is designed to protect customers by ensuring firms can promptly return customer securities and cash if the firm fails. The rule sets different minimum capital levels based on the firm's type of business."

    "front": "What are the two methods for computing net capital?",
    "back": "The basic method requires net capital equal to the greater of a fixed minimum or 6-2/3% of aggregate indebtedness. The alternative method requires net capital of the greater of a fixed minimum or 2% of aggregate debit items. Most large firms use the alternative method. Both methods require firms to value assets at market (haircuts) and exclude illiquid assets."

    "front": "What are haircuts in the context of net capital?",
    "back": "Haircuts are percentage deductions applied to the market value of securities positions when computing net capital. They account for the risk that securities may decline in value before they can be liquidated. Different types of securities have different haircut percentages: government securities have small haircuts while equity positions and options have larger ones."
