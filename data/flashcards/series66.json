    "back": "The Series 66 (Uniform Combined State Law Examination) combines the content of the Series 63 and Series 65 exams. Passing the Series 66 along with the Series 7 qualifies an individual as both a securities agent and an investment adviser representative at the state level. It covers state securities regulation and investment advisory practices."

    "back": "The de minimis exemption allows an investment adviser without a place of business in a state to avoid registration in that state if they have five or fewer clients who are residents of that state during the preceding 12 months. This exemption makes it practical for advisers to serve a small number of out-of-state clients without registering in every state."

    "back": "A wrap fee program charges a single bundled fee covering investment advisory services, brokerage execution, and custodial services.

Advisers offering wrap programs must deliver a wrap fee brochure (Form ADV Part 2A, Appendix 1) disclosing the services, fees, and potential conflicts of interest."

    "back": "Best execution is the obligation of an investment adviser to seek the most favorable terms for client transactions, considering factors such as price, commission costs, speed of execution, and the broker-dealer's reliability. Advisers may consider research and other services (soft dollars) when selecting broker-dealers, but best execution must remain the primary consideration."

    "back": "Soft dollar arrangements occur when an adviser directs brokerage transactions to a broker-dealer in exchange for research or other services that benefit the adviser. Under Section 28(e) safe harbor, soft dollars may only be used for eligible research and brokerage services. The adviser must disclose soft dollar practices and ensure they benefit clients."

    "back": "A principal transaction occurs when an adviser, acting as a dealer, buys a security from or sells a security to a client's account from the adviser's own inventory. Principal transactions require disclosure of the adviser's capacity and written client consent before completion of each transaction. This prevents advisers from dumping unwanted securities on clients."

    "back": "An agency cross transaction occurs when an adviser acts as broker for both the advisory client and another party on the other side of the transaction. The adviser must disclose the dual capacity, obtain written client consent, confirm the transaction in writing, and send an annual statement identifying all such transactions. This arrangement presents inherent conflicts of interest."

    "back": "The time value of money is the concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This principle underpins present value and future value calculations. It is used to evaluate investments, compare cash flows at different times, and determine the fair value of assets."

    "back": "Growth investing focuses on companies with above-average earnings growth potential, typically with high P/E ratios and low or no dividends. Value investing seeks undervalued stocks trading below their intrinsic value, often with low P/E ratios and higher dividend yields. Growth stocks carry higher risk but offer greater upside, while value stocks may provide more stability."

Investors can deduct up to $3,000 of net capital losses against ordinary income annually, with excess losses carried forward.

It runs thousands of scenarios with varying market returns, inflation, and other variables to estimate the likelihood of achieving financial goals.

    "back": "NSMIA (1996) established a framework dividing regulatory authority between federal and state governments. It preempted state registration for 'covered securities' (listed on national exchanges, federal covered investment companies, and Rule 506 offerings). States retained anti-fraud authority over all securities and registration authority over non-covered securities."

    "back": "Under the SEC's Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1, effective November 4, 2023), the term 'solicitor' has been replaced by 'promoter.' When an investment adviser compensates a promoter for referring clients, the adviser must have a written agreement with the promoter and ensure the promoter discloses at the time of solicitation: the fact that they are being compensated, the compensation arrangement, and any material conflicts of interest. The adviser must have a reasonable basis for believing the promoter complies with the agreement and is not a disqualified person."

    "back": "State-registered investment advisers with custody of client funds must maintain a minimum net worth (typically $35,000). Advisers with discretionary authority but no custody must maintain a lower minimum (typically $10,000). If net worth falls below the requirement, the adviser must notify the state Administrator. These requirements protect clients against adviser insolvency."

    "back": "Rebalancing is the process of realigning a portfolio's asset allocation back to its target percentages by buying or selling assets. Over time, market movements cause actual allocations to drift from targets. Regular rebalancing (calendar-based or threshold-based) maintains the desired risk-return profile and enforces a disciplined investment approach."

    "back": "When a broker-dealer or investment adviser merges with or is acquired by another firm, the successor firm may continue operations under the predecessor's registration for a limited period while filing a new registration.

    "back": "The fiduciary standard requires investment advisers to act in the client's best interest at all times, placing client interests above their own. The suitability standard requires broker-dealers to recommend investments that are suitable based on the client's profile. The fiduciary standard is considered more stringent because it requires ongoing duty and full conflict disclosure."

    "back": "Discretionary authority allows an investment adviser to make investment decisions and execute trades on behalf of a client without obtaining the client's prior approval for each transaction. The client must grant this authority in writing. The adviser must still act within the guidelines of the investment policy statement and in the client's best interest."

    "back": "Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates, expressed in years. It estimates the percentage change in a bond's price for a 1% change in interest rates. A duration of 5 means the bond's price would change approximately 5% for each 1% change in rates. Longer duration means greater interest rate risk. Duration is inversely related to coupon rate."

    "back": "A notice filing is a streamlined registration process for federal covered securities at the state level. Since these securities are exempt from full state registration under NSMIA, states may only require issuers to file a notice and pay a fee. This applies to securities of registered investment companies and certain Regulation D offerings."
