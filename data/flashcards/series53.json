    "front": "What is a competitive underwriting for municipal bonds?",
    "back": "In a competitive underwriting, the issuer publishes a Notice of Sale inviting dealer syndicates to submit sealed bids.

    "front": "What is a negotiated underwriting for municipal bonds?",
    "back": "In a negotiated underwriting, the issuer selects an underwriter through direct negotiation rather than competitive bidding. The terms, including the underwriting spread and pricing, are negotiated between the issuer and the managing underwriter.

    "back": "In an Eastern (undivided) account, each syndicate member is responsible for their proportionate share of unsold bonds regardless of whether they sold their own allocation. In a Western (divided) account, each member is only liable for their own allocation. The Eastern account is more common in municipal underwriting because it provides greater protection to the issuer."
