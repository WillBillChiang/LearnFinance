    "back": "An Operations Professional performs critical back-office functions at a broker-dealer, including trade processing, settlement, clearance, custody, account transfers, margin operations, and regulatory reporting. The Series 99 exam qualifies individuals for these non-sales operational roles. Operations professionals ensure trades are processed accurately and in compliance with regulations."

    "back": "The trade life cycle includes: (1) order placement by the customer, (2) order execution on the market, (3) trade capture and booking, (4) trade confirmation sent to the customer, (5) clearing through a clearinghouse (matching and netting), and (6) settlement (delivery of securities and payment). Each step involves specific operational processes and regulatory requirements."

    "front": "What is the standard settlement cycle for most securities?",
    "back": "Most securities in the U.S. settle on a T+1 basis, meaning one business day after the trade date. This applies to stocks, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and ETFs. Government securities also settle T+1. Options contracts settle T+1. The shortened settlement cycle reduces counterparty risk and aligns with global market efficiency standards."

    "front": "What is continuous net settlement (CNS)?",
    "back": "CNS is a settlement system used by NSCC that nets all buy and sell transactions in the same security into a single obligation per participant per day. This dramatically reduces the number of securities and cash that must be delivered, lowering settlement risk and operational costs. CNS is the primary settlement system for U.S. equities."

    "topicName": "Settlement and Clearance",
    "front": "What happens when a trade fails to settle?",
    "back": "A failed trade occurs when either the securities or the cash is not delivered by the settlement date. The delivering party fails to deliver (FTD) and the receiving party fails to receive (FTR). Failed trades increase counterparty risk and may result in buy-in procedures, penalties, or regulatory action. SEC Rule 204 requires mandatory close-out of fails in equity securities."

    "front": "What is DVP (Delivery Versus Payment)?",
    "back": "DVP is a settlement mechanism where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment, eliminating the risk that one party delivers without receiving the corresponding payment. DVP is the standard for institutional trades and ensures that neither party is exposed to settlement risk. If either side fails, the entire transaction is unwound."

    "back": "A stock split increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the price per share. In a 2-for-1 split, shareholders receive twice as many shares at half the price. Operations must adjust customer positions, cost basis records, and outstanding orders.
