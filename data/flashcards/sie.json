    "back": "The Federal Reserve Board is the central bank of the United States responsible for monetary policy. Its primary tools include setting the federal funds rate target, conducting open market operations (buying and selling government securities), adjusting the discount rate, and paying interest on reserve balances (IORB). Note: Reserve requirements were reduced to zero in March 2020 and are no longer actively used as a monetary policy tool. The Fed now operates under an 'ample reserves' framework, using IORB as a key tool to steer short-term interest rates."

    "back": "The yield curve is a graph plotting interest rates of bonds with equal credit quality across different maturities. A normal yield curve slopes upward, with longer maturities offering higher yields. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term rates exceed long-term rates and has historically been a predictor of economic recession, suggesting investors expect future economic weakness and lower rates."

    "back": "A corporate bond is a debt security issued by a corporation to raise capital, with a promise to pay periodic interest (coupon) and return the principal (par value, typically $1,000) at maturity. Corporate bonds are quoted as a percentage of par value. For example, a bond quoted at 98 is trading at 98% of $1,000, or $980 (at a discount), while a bond at 103 trades at $1,030 (at a premium)."

    "back": "Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall because newly issued bonds offer higher yields, making older bonds less attractive. When interest rates fall, existing bond prices rise. This is known as interest rate risk, and it affects bonds with longer maturities and lower coupon rates more significantly."

The issuer pledges its ability to levy taxes (property taxes, income taxes, etc.) to pay debt service. GO bonds typically require voter approval and are considered lower risk than revenue bonds because they are supported by the issuer's overall taxing authority."

    "back": "Inflation risk, also called purchasing power risk, is the risk that the return on an investment will not keep pace with inflation, causing a loss of real purchasing power. Fixed-income investments and cash are most vulnerable because their returns are fixed while the cost of goods and services rises. Equities and real assets generally provide better inflation protection over the long term."

Thinly traded securities, limited partnerships, certain real estate investments, and small-cap stocks may have higher liquidity risk. Highly liquid investments include large-cap stocks on major exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities. Low liquidity can result in wider bid-ask spreads and price concessions."

This is particularly relevant for callable bonds, which may be called when rates fall, forcing investors to reinvest at lower yields. Zero-coupon bonds eliminate reinvestment risk because there are no periodic coupon payments to reinvest."

Treasury notes have maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years and pay semiannual interest. Treasury bonds have maturities of 20 or 30 years and also pay semiannual interest.

    "back": "TIPS are U.S. Treasury securities designed to protect investors against inflation. The principal value is adjusted daily using an Index Ratio published by the U.S. Treasury, based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The coupon rate is fixed but is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal, so semiannual interest payments increase with inflation and decrease with deflation. At maturity, the investor receives the greater of the adjusted principal or the original par value. The inflation adjustment to principal is taxable in the year it occurs, even though the adjusted principal is not received until maturity."

The conversion ratio specifies how many shares the bondholder receives. Convertible bonds typically offer lower coupon rates than non-convertible bonds because of the added value of the conversion feature.

    "back": "Regulation T, established by the Federal Reserve Board, governs the extension of credit by broker-dealers to customers. It sets the initial margin requirement at 50% of the purchase price of marginable securities, meaning investors must deposit at least half the cost of the securities they purchase on margin. Reg T also covers payment timing for cash accounts and rules for free-riding violations."

    "back": "In a Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS) account, when one owner dies, their share passes directly to the surviving owner(s), bypassing probate. All owners have equal and undivided interest. In a Tenants in Common (TIC) account, each owner may have an unequal share, and upon death, their share passes to their estate (not to the surviving owners) according to their will."

    "back": "A market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. Market orders guarantee execution but not a specific price. They are the fastest type of order to fill and are appropriate when speed of execution is more important than the exact price. In volatile markets, the execution price may differ significantly from the last quoted price."

    "back": "A limit order specifies the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay or the minimum price a seller is willing to accept. A buy limit order is placed below the current market price, and a sell limit order is placed above the current market price. Limit orders guarantee the price (or better) but do not guarantee execution; the order will only fill if the market reaches the specified price."

    "back": "A stop order becomes a market order once the stock reaches a specified stop price. A sell stop is placed below the current market price to limit losses or protect profits on a long position. A buy stop is placed above the current market price to limit losses on a short position or enter a position on a breakout. Once triggered, the order executes at the next available price, which may differ from the stop price."

    "back": "Settlement is the process of transferring ownership of securities and payment between buyer and seller. Regular-way settlement for most securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and options) is T+1 (trade date plus one business day). U.S. government securities also settle T+1. Cash trades settle on the same day (T+0). Settlement ensures the buyer receives securities and the seller receives payment."

    "back": "A Traditional IRA is a tax-advantaged retirement account. Contributions may be tax-deductible (depending on income and access to employer plans), and earnings grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 73. Early withdrawals before age 59 1/2 generally incur a 10% penalty plus income taxes, with certain exceptions."

    "back": "A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax contributions (not tax-deductible), but qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Unlike a Traditional IRA, Roth IRAs have no required minimum distributions (RMDs) during the owner's lifetime. Contributions (not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. Roth IRAs have income eligibility limits that phase out at higher income levels."

The minor is the beneficial owner, and gifts are irrevocable. Only one custodian is named at a time. Margin trading and short selling are prohibited. The custodian manages the account in a fiduciary capacity until the minor reaches the age of majority, at which point the assets transfer to the former minor."

    "back": "Short selling is the practice of selling borrowed securities with the expectation that the price will decline, allowing the investor to buy them back at a lower price and profit from the difference. The investor borrows shares from the broker-dealer and must eventually return them. Short selling requires a margin account and carries unlimited loss potential since the stock price can theoretically rise without limit."

    "back": "Churning is the prohibited practice of excessive trading in a customer's account primarily to generate commissions for the broker rather than to benefit the customer. For churning to occur, the representative must have control over the account (either through discretionary authority or de facto control). Indicators include high turnover ratios, excessive commission-to-equity ratios, and frequent in-and-out trading with little net benefit to the customer."

    "back": "A discretionary account is a brokerage account in which the customer authorizes the registered representative to make investment decisions (including what to buy or sell, how much, and when) without obtaining the customer's prior approval for each trade. Discretionary authority requires written authorization from the customer. Each discretionary trade must be marked as such and reviewed by a principal on the day the trade is entered."

    "back": "A margin call occurs when the equity in a margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirement (FINRA minimum is 25%, but most firms require 30-35%). The customer must deposit additional funds or securities to bring the account back into compliance. If the customer fails to meet the margin call, the broker-dealer may liquidate securities in the account without prior notice to restore the required equity level."

Common forms include wash trading (buying and selling the same security to create the appearance of activity), matched orders (coordinating buy and sell orders to create false impressions), painting the tape (reporting false transactions), and pump and dump schemes (artificially inflating a stock's price before selling). All forms are prohibited under securities laws."

Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), adopted by the SEC, raises the standard by requiring broker-dealers to act in the best interest of the customer at the time of a recommendation, going beyond traditional suitability by requiring disclosure, care, conflict of interest management, and compliance."

    "back": "The ex-dividend date is the first day a stock trades without the entitlement to the most recently declared dividend. An investor must purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date to receive the dividend. On the ex-date, the stock price typically drops by approximately the dividend amount. Under T+1 settlement (effective May 28, 2024), the ex-dividend date is the same day as the record date. An investor must buy at least one business day before the ex-date to settle in time. The key dates in order are: declaration date, ex-dividend date (= record date under T+1), payable date."

    "back": "Free-riding occurs when a customer buys securities in a cash account, sells them before paying for them in full, and uses the sale proceeds to pay for the original purchase. This violates Regulation T because the customer never actually had the funds to pay for the purchase. If a free-riding violation occurs, the broker-dealer must freeze the account for 90 days, during which the customer must pay in full before any purchases."
