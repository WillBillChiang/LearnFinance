    "back": "A research analyst evaluates securities, industries, and markets to produce investment recommendations for investors. Analysts perform fundamental and technical analysis, build financial models, write research reports, and communicate findings. The Series 86/87 qualifies individuals as research analysts. Analysts must follow strict rules to maintain objectivity and manage conflicts of interest."

    "front": "What is fundamental analysis?",
    "back": "Fundamental analysis evaluates a security's intrinsic value by examining the company's financial statements, management quality, competitive position, industry dynamics, and macroeconomic factors. It uses metrics like P/E ratios, EPS growth, ROE, and cash flow to determine whether a security is overvalued or undervalued relative to its current market price."

    "back": "Technical analysis evaluates securities by analyzing statistical patterns in trading activity, including price movements, volume, and chart patterns. Technical analysts believe that historical trading patterns can predict future price movements. Common tools include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), MACD, support and resistance levels, and chart formations."

    "back": "The three primary financial statements are: (1) the income statement, which shows revenue, expenses, and profit over a period; (2) the balance sheet, which shows assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time; and (3) the cash flow statement, which shows cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities."

    "back": "Operating cash flow (OCF) represents cash generated from normal business operations, calculated from the cash flow statement. Free cash flow (FCF) equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. FCF represents the cash available for distribution to investors after maintaining and expanding the asset base. FCF is considered a superior measure of financial health."

    "back": "ROE measures a company's profitability relative to shareholders' equity, calculated as Net Income / Shareholders' Equity. A higher ROE indicates more efficient use of equity capital. The DuPont analysis breaks ROE into three components: profit margin (Net Income/Revenue) x asset turnover (Revenue/Total Assets) x equity multiplier (Total Assets/Equity), revealing the drivers of profitability."

    "back": "The P/E ratio measures the price investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings, calculated as Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share. A higher P/E suggests investors expect higher future growth or are willing to pay a premium. Trailing P/E uses historical earnings, while forward P/E uses projected earnings. P/E ratios vary significantly across industries."

    "front": "What is the debt-to-equity ratio?",
    "back": "The debt-to-equity ratio measures a company's financial leverage by dividing total debt by total shareholders' equity. A higher ratio indicates greater reliance on debt financing, which increases financial risk but can enhance returns on equity through leverage. Different industries have different typical ranges. Analysts compare this ratio to industry peers and historical trends."

    "back": "The DDM values a stock based on the present value of expected future dividends. The Gordon Growth Model (constant growth DDM) formula is: Price = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the expected dividend, r is the required rate of return, and g is the constant growth rate. DDM is most appropriate for mature companies with stable, predictable dividend policies."

    "back": "The PEG (Price/Earnings to Growth) ratio divides the P/E ratio by the expected earnings growth rate. A PEG of 1.0 suggests fair valuation relative to growth. A PEG below 1.0 may indicate the stock is undervalued relative to its growth, while above 1.0 may indicate overvaluation. PEG is useful for comparing companies with different growth rates within the same industry."

    "front": "What is the EV/EBITDA multiple?",
    "back": "EV/EBITDA compares enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It is preferred over P/E for comparing companies with different capital structures because EV includes both equity and debt, and EBITDA is pre-financing. Lower ratios may suggest undervaluation. The multiple varies by industry, growth rate, and profitability."

    "back": "SOTP valuation values a diversified company by separately valuing each business segment or division using appropriate methods and multiples, then summing the values. This approach recognizes that different business units may warrant different valuations. A conglomerate discount may exist if the market values the combined company below the SOTP value."

Industries with weak forces tend to be more profitable. Analysts use this framework to assess the attractiveness and dynamics of an industry."

    "back": "The industry life cycle has four stages: (1) Introduction/pioneering with high growth but low profitability, (2) Growth with rapidly increasing demand and improving margins, (3) Maturity with stable demand, intense competition, and consolidation, and (4) Decline with shrinking demand and exit of competitors. Each stage has different investment characteristics and appropriate valuation approaches."

    "back": "Cyclical industries (automobiles, construction, luxury goods) are highly sensitive to economic cycles, with earnings that rise and fall with GDP. Defensive industries (utilities, healthcare, consumer staples) maintain relatively stable earnings regardless of economic conditions. Understanding cyclicality helps analysts time recommendations and set appropriate valuation expectations."

    "back": "Under FINRA Rule 2241 (effective 2015, Regulatory Notice 15-30), research analysts at firms that participated as underwriter or dealer in an IPO must observe a minimum 10-calendar-day quiet period (reduced from 40/25 days under old NASD Rule 2711). For secondary offerings, managers and co-managers must observe a 3-day quiet period. These quiet periods do not apply to Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) or covered investment funds. Structural safeguards also remain in effect, including information barriers between research and investment banking, prohibition on IB pre-approval of research content, restrictions on analyst compensation tied to investment banking revenue, and requirements that research opinions reflect the analyst's genuine views."

    "back": "Working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities and measures a company's short-term liquidity.

    "back": "Sensitivity analysis examines how changes in key assumptions (such as revenue growth, margins, discount rates, or terminal multiples) affect a valuation outcome. It is typically presented as a data table showing a range of values. This technique helps analysts understand which variables have the greatest impact on value and communicate uncertainty around estimates."

    "back": "Top-down analysis starts with macroeconomic and market conditions, then narrows to sectors, industries, and individual companies. Bottom-up analysis starts with individual company fundamentals and builds upward. Top-down emphasizes economic trends and sector rotation, while bottom-up focuses on finding undervalued companies regardless of macro conditions. Many analysts use a combination."

    "back": "A price target is an analyst's projection of a security's future price, typically over a 12-month horizon. It is based on the analyst's valuation work and expectations for the company and its industry. Price targets are communicated alongside buy, hold, or sell ratings. They provide investors with a quantitative assessment of expected return potential."

Companies with wide moats command higher valuations."
