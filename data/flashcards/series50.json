    "back": "A municipal advisor is a person or firm that provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities.

    "front": "What is the difference between a municipal advisor and an underwriter?",
    "back": "A municipal advisor provides independent advice to the issuer and owes a fiduciary duty. An underwriter purchases securities from the issuer for resale and has an arm's-length business relationship, not a fiduciary one. Under MSRB Rule G-17, underwriters must disclose that they are not acting as advisors. A firm generally cannot serve as both advisor and underwriter on the same transaction."

    "back": "Municipal advisors owe a fiduciary duty to their municipal entity clients, which includes a duty of loyalty (acting in the client's best interest and putting client interests first), a duty of care (exercising due diligence and providing competent advice), and an obligation to fully disclose all material conflicts of interest. This is the highest standard of care in the securities industry."

    "back": "Municipal advisors must disclose all material conflicts of interest, including compensation arrangements that could affect impartiality, relationships with other parties in the transaction (underwriters, banks, swap dealers), financial interests in recommended products, affiliate relationships, and any other circumstances that could compromise the advisor's ability to provide independent advice."

    "back": "Municipal advisors owe a full fiduciary duty to municipal entity clients. For obligated persons (private entities obligated to pay on municipal securities, such as conduit borrowers), advisors must deal fairly and not engage in deceptive practices but do not owe a fiduciary duty. This distinction reflects the different nature of the advisory relationships."

    "back": "An interest rate swap is a derivative in which a municipality exchanges fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments (or vice versa) with a counterparty. Municipalities commonly use swaps to convert variable-rate debt to a synthetic fixed rate or to reduce borrowing costs. Risks include counterparty risk, basis risk, termination risk, and tax risk. Municipal advisors must explain all risks."

    "front": "What is basis risk in a municipal swap?",
    "back": "Basis risk occurs when the floating-rate index used in a swap does not perfectly match the actual floating rate the municipality pays on its variable-rate bonds. For example, if the swap references SOFR but the bond rate is based on SIFMA, differences between these indices create basis risk. The municipality may pay more (or less) than the synthetic fixed rate intended."

It represents the average rate reset on tax-exempt variable-rate demand obligations. Municipal advisors use SIFMA as a reference rate for swap pricing and analysis.
